Broccoli soup is one of my favorite dishes since I was a kid.
This is a pretty straightforward recipe: roast/sweat vegetables, simmer in stock and buttermilk, and blend.
I wish I had roasted my broccoli longer as the flavor wasn't that pronounced, but I was getting impatient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The toasted pepitas were very good.
I really like the combination of crunchy seeds with parsley and lemon zest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, I think this recipe is good, but can be improved.
I think next time I will include some rosted cauliflower to round out the the flavor.
And I'll add cheese because it makes everything better.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>broccoli</category><category>buttermilk</category><category>pepitas</category><category>Serious Eats</category><category>soup</category><guid>https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/roasted-broccoli-soup/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 01 Oct 2022 18:19:33 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
