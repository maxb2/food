Kenji Lopez-Alt's &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5nKYqvu29w"&gt;video on buttermilk brined fried ckicken&lt;/a&gt; which is &lt;a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/the-food-lab-southern-fried-chicken-recipe"&gt;adapted from his book&lt;/a&gt;.
He offered to cook everything if I broke down the whole chicken. 
I really enjoy breaking down whole chickens so that I can save the carcass for stock.
I even asked for a nice boning knife one Christmas solely for processing whole chicken and fish.
There is one oddity in this recipe in which you leave the plate attached, but cut the breast in half the short way resulting in 4 square-ish pieces. 
In my case, the tenderloin separated from the breast and the plate which made it very awkward to fry. 
We ended up with a couple tenderloin nuggets because of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also made &lt;a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/light-and-fluffy-biscuit-recipe"&gt;yogurt biscuits&lt;/a&gt; with the leftover buttermilk.
Ironically, this recipe was originally developed to replace buttermilk with yogurt.
My biscuits came out a bit dense. I imagine that the pH balance was off due to the buttermilk which affected the rise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chicken was pretty good, but we found that the second fry didn't add much more value for the extra time and effort.
It's only worth it if you are obsessed with crispiness.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>biscuits</category><category>buttermilk</category><category>chicken</category><category>fried</category><guid>https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/buttermilk-brined-fried-chicken-and-biscuits/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 03 Apr 2022 19:38:26 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Halal Cart-Style Chicken and Tzatziki</title><link>https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/halal-cart-style-chicken-and-tzatziki/</link><dc:creator>Matt Anderson</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;My roommate has a favorite &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOkL5d8t1sM"&gt;tzatziki recipe&lt;/a&gt; he likes to make.
When he told me he was going to make that and nothing else, I decided to help him round out the meal. 
I made the chicken and rice from Serious Eats' &lt;a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/serious-eats-halal-cart-style-chicken-and-rice-white-sauce-recipe"&gt;Halal Cart-Style Chicken and Rice with White Sauce&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href="https://www.themediterraneandish.com/tabouli-salad/"&gt;Tabouli salad&lt;/a&gt;.
I made the rice with some homemade chicken stock as well.
May favorite part of the meal is the chicken. 
The marinade is really excellent!&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>chicken</category><category>condiment</category><category>mediterranean</category><category>rice</category><category>salad</category><category>tzatziki</category><guid>https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/halal-cart-style-chicken-and-tzatziki/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 09 Mar 2022 18:17:18 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Chicken Katsu Sandwiches</title><link>https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/chicken-katsu-sandwiches/</link><dc:creator>Matt Anderson</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;I still have a bunch of coleslaw from the &lt;a href="https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/impromptu-bbq-potluck/"&gt;Impromptu BBQ Potluck&lt;/a&gt; so my roommate suggested we make &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOsikxHW0JQ"&gt;spicy chicken katsu sandwiches&lt;/a&gt;. 
The original recipe uses lettuce and a spicy pickle mayo, but I think the coleslaw was even better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We bought extra thighs for an upcoming meal which I deboned and deskinned. 
I'll save the bones for chicken stock and the skin for schmaltz.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>chicken</category><category>coleslaw</category><category>katsu</category><category>sandwich</category><category>spicy</category><guid>https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/chicken-katsu-sandwiches/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 08 Mar 2022 02:34:39 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
