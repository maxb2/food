I decided to challenge myself a little and make empanadas.
I used the dough from &lt;a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/smoky-potato-and-caper-empanadas-with-cilantr-recipe"&gt;this recipe&lt;/a&gt; which incorporates some &lt;a href="https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/masa-ball-soup-and-champurrado/"&gt;masa and chicken fat&lt;/a&gt; (other rarely used pantry ingredients).
This made the dough a little harder to work with as it was prone to tearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the filling, I winged it.
I minced a red bell pepper, sauteed that with the meat, and added some chipotle in adobo sauce to form a sloppy joe like filling.
I was able to practice forming and crimping the empanadas.
After frying, I saved the prettiest ones for my friend in the freezer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The empanadas were good on their own, but the green sauce from the above empanada recipe really completed the experience.
The acid from the limes cut through the gamey flavors.
The one thing I didn't like was how much oil the dough absorbed.
You could really tell when reheating them from frozen, because it would come bubbling out.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>chipotle</category><category>deer</category><category>empanadas</category><category>masa</category><category>pantry raid</category><category>Serious Eats</category><guid>https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/ground-deer-empanadas/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 15 Aug 2022 19:34:14 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Stuffed Cabbage Rolls (Golubtsi)</title><link>https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/stuffed-cabbage-rolls-golubtsi/</link><dc:creator>Matt Anderson</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;I recently saw &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/helenrennie"&gt;Helen Rennie's&lt;/a&gt; video for stuffed cabbage rolls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I love cabbage, I really wanted to try it.
I have a few pounds of ground deer meat that I got from a hunter friend, so I replaced the veal in the meatloaf mix with deer.
I also used the optional gelatin as a safegaurd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trimming the stems of the cabbage leaves was a great way to increase the flexibility of the leaves.
The filling was still a bit too crumbly at the end.
I could add more binders to the mix (breadcrumbs and eggs), and/or knead the mixture more to get it tighter.
My sauce also didn't reduce much during the braise, but that is not a problem when serving the rolls browned as suggested in the video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of steps in the process, but it felt very manageable with two people.
One of us focused on the cabbage and sauce while the other focused on the filling and forming of the rolls.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>beef</category><category>cabbage</category><category>carrot</category><category>deer</category><category>golubtsi</category><category>Helen Rennie</category><category>meatloaf</category><category>pantry raid</category><category>rice</category><category>stuffed</category><category>tomato</category><category>Youtube</category><guid>https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/stuffed-cabbage-rolls-golubtsi/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 29 May 2022 22:50:18 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
