I had some lentils in the pantry, so we made &lt;a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/roasted-eggplant-tahini-pine-nut-lentil-vegan-experience-recipe"&gt;roasted eggplant with tahini, pine nuts, and lentils&lt;/a&gt;. 
I made the &lt;a href="https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/vegetable-stock/"&gt;vegan stock&lt;/a&gt; early for the base of this dish.
It really elevated the lentils.
My roommate made his favorite tahini sauce, as always.
However, my favorite part was the roasted eggplant with rosemary.
The silky texture with the fresh, astringent rosemary was really perfect.
Overall, I didn't think the tahini fit well with the dish.
It was overloading the earthy flavors.
We needed to add a lot of lemon and hot sauce to balance everything again.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>eggplant</category><category>lentils</category><category>pantry raid</category><category>pine nuts</category><category>Serious Eats</category><category>tahini</category><category>vegetarian</category><guid>https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/roasted-eggplant-with-tahini-pine-nuts-and-lentils/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 09 Aug 2022 12:58:59 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
