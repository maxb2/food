She requested that we have a fish fry which is something we used to do a lot growing up.
It would be a big potluck for the small river town that we spent a lot of time at.
The fishermen would catch a bunch of catfish, carp, and walleye and then spend all day frying them.
There would also be a ton of side dishes and lawn games.
It was a formative memory for all of us kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She also said she was bringing sweet corn and I had recently seen Kenji's video on &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zhe4xOaypO4"&gt;sweet corn elotes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Zhe4xOaypO4" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I brought &lt;a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/two-minute-mayonnaise"&gt;homemade mayo&lt;/a&gt;, cotija cheese, and my popcorn spice blend.
The popcorn spice blend came from a New York Times article a long time ago, which is no longer available sadly.
I've forgotten the exact ratios, but it consists of paprika, cayenne, salt, garlic powder, and pepper.
It's basically a grilling spice blend such as Lawry's.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made the elotes just like in the video and it was amazing!
I think it's way better than just buttered corn.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>corn</category><category>family farm</category><category>grill</category><category>Kenji</category><category>mayo</category><category>Youtube</category><guid>https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/sweet-corn-elotes/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 20 Aug 2022 23:51:06 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
