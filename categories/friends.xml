It presented a couple challenges though.
First, I decided to make a double recipe and split it three ways.
There are lot's of respiratory irritants (chili powder and sliced shallots) in this recipe so there was constant coughing, sneezing, and crying (In retrospect, not the best idea to do with friends).
We were also cooking at my friend's house rather than my kitchen.
This was only a minor challenge in that I was in charge but unfamiliar with the equipment which led to some last second scrambling.
And lastly, we started at 8PM which was a big mistake. We didn't finish until 11:30PM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was still a lot of fun and we all got something to show for it.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>chili</category><category>crisp</category><category>factory</category><category>friends</category><category>seriouseats</category><category>spicy</category><guid>https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/chili-crisp-factory/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 11 Apr 2022 00:45:08 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Impromptu BBQ Potluck</title><link>https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/impromptu-bbq-potluck/</link><dc:creator>Matt Anderson</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;My friend with a smoker decided to randomly make some pulled pork this weekend. 
We decided to have an impromptu potluck.
I signed up to make the side dishes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My friend and I had previously lamented the over-doneness of mac and cheese at typical BBQ restaurants.
So, I made some &lt;a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/classic-bechamel-baked-mac-cheese-recipe"&gt;classic baked mac and cheese&lt;/a&gt;. 
It is just parcooked pasta in a mornay sauce with breadcrumbs on top that is baked like a casserole. 
I used cellentani instead of elbow macaroni because I like the shape better.
I also added a pinch of truffle powder to the sauce for extra flavor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I typically don't like creamy American coleslaw because of its cloying sweetness.
However, I really wanted to top the pulled pork sandwiches with something. 
I made &lt;a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/the-food-lab-how-to-make-the-best-creamy-cole-slaw"&gt;creamy coleslaw&lt;/a&gt; by J. Kenji Lopez-Alt.
Even though it makes a giant mess, I really like this recipe.
I think the keys to success are "curing" the vegetables, and using the best quality mayonnaise.
The best quality mayo will always be homemade.
J. Kenji also has a great (fast) &lt;a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/two-minute-mayonnaise"&gt;mayo recipe&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I wanted an alternative to the coleslaw, so I made &lt;a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/quick-dill-pickle-chips-recipe"&gt;quick pickles&lt;/a&gt;. 
They taste strongly of dill, garlic, and vinegar which is my favorite kind of pickle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, it was a great success!&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>Americana</category><category>barbeque</category><category>BBQ</category><category>friends</category><category>potluck</category><category>seriouseats</category><category>side-dish</category><guid>https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/impromptu-bbq-potluck/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 06 Mar 2022 18:58:05 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
