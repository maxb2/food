I enjoyed the texture the most, creamy and firm at the same time.
I randomly got a craving for it.
I found a great &lt;a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/classic-panna-cotta-vanilla-bean-recipe"&gt;blank slate recipe&lt;/a&gt; upon which to build.
However, I wanted some stronger flavors.
So, I steeped some crushed ginger and lemon peels in the warm milk for a couple hours.
The combination of sharp flavors and smooth texture was really delightful.
The acidic blackberries enhanced the effect too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I did make one mistake.
I didn't let the mixture cool long enough and the cream separated from the gelatin a bit.
It was only a visual defect though.
The dish is really delightful and simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made this recipe again steeping overnight, properly cooling before pouring, and served with blueberries.
The longer steeping created more flavor and also produced a yellow oil on the top (most likely oils from the lemon peels).
The blueberries I had were not strong enough to compete with the lemon and ginger.
I'd like to try macerated fruits next time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My friend also brought up that she had made "ginger milk pudding" before.
Apparently, there is a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ginger_milk_curd"&gt;compound in ginger&lt;/a&gt; that can curdle milk at the right temperature.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>dessert</category><category>fruit</category><category>gelatin</category><category>ginger</category><category>lemon</category><category>milk</category><category>Serious Eats</category><guid>https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/ginger-lemon-panna-cotta-with-blackberries/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 06 Aug 2022 20:49:48 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
