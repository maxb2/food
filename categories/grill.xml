She requested that we have a fish fry which is something we used to do a lot growing up.
It would be a big potluck for the small river town that we spent a lot of time at.
The fishermen would catch a bunch of catfish, carp, and walleye and then spend all day frying them.
There would also be a ton of side dishes and lawn games.
It was a formative memory for all of us kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She also said she was bringing sweet corn and I had recently seen Kenji's video on &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zhe4xOaypO4"&gt;sweet corn elotes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Zhe4xOaypO4" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I brought &lt;a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/two-minute-mayonnaise"&gt;homemade mayo&lt;/a&gt;, cotija cheese, and my popcorn spice blend.
The popcorn spice blend came from a New York Times article a long time ago, which is no longer available sadly.
I've forgotten the exact ratios, but it consists of paprika, cayenne, salt, garlic powder, and pepper.
It's basically a grilling spice blend such as Lawry's.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made the elotes just like in the video and it was amazing!
I think it's way better than just buttered corn.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>corn</category><category>family farm</category><category>grill</category><category>Kenji</category><category>mayo</category><category>Youtube</category><guid>https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/sweet-corn-elotes/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 20 Aug 2022 23:51:06 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Peruvian Style Chicken Sandwiches</title><link>https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/peruvian-style-chicken-sandwiches/</link><dc:creator>Matt Anderson</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;My roommate always wants to make &lt;a href="https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/chicken-katsu-sandwiches/"&gt;fried chicken sandwiches&lt;/a&gt;.
This time I wanted to switch it up and make something a little different, &lt;a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/peruvian-style-grilled-chicken-sandwiches-recipe"&gt;Peruvian-Style Grilled-Chicken Sandwiches With Spicy Green Sauce&lt;/a&gt; and grilled vegetables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went to a hardware store and bought the tiniest charcoal grill since my patio is also tiny.
I tried to grill the vegetables quickly over the chimney charcoal starter, but it was not going well.
I ended up switching to the grill to finish them off which went well.
The first batch of chicken breasts grilled nicely, though they didn't get grill marks or carmelize the sauce much.
By the time we got the final batch of chicken on the grill, it had been too long and wasn't hot enough to even cook the chicken at all.
We quickly pivoted to the oven to finish everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The end results were very tasty despite all the stress.
I liked the green sauce in particular.
I really want to try this again on a functioning grill.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>chicken</category><category>grill</category><category>mistake</category><category>Peruvian</category><category>sandwich</category><category>Serious Eats</category><category>vegetables</category><guid>https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/peruvian-style-chicken-sandwiches/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 02 Aug 2022 03:07:35 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
