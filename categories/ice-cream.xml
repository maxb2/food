We would make the most annoying menus possible for hypothetical events.
It would include Baked Alaska, Beef Wellington, truffle anything, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, when I saw a video for &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEUSxRNlodc"&gt;practical Baked Alaska&lt;/a&gt; I knew I had to try it.
It also helped that my friends were having a small Independence Day gathering and that I'm looking for stand mixer projects to use my new toy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The practical approach is to make each component separately and assemble in one pan.
The chocolate cake is dense, almost a brownie, and has a large fat ration to keep it from freezing rock hard.
The best approach for the ice cream is to just buy it and let it soften a little before spreading on the chilled cake.
My favorite part of this recipe is that while the egg yolks and whites are separated, they are all used.
I really hate having egg parts hanging around in the fridge that I can't find a use for.
The Italian Meringue was straight forward, but it was my first time making any meringue.
I'm just grateful that I didn't splatter the lava hot syrup on myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, you just layer everything in the cake pan and freeze until serving.
Before serving, you are supposed to scorch the meringue to add a toasted marshmallow flavor.
I went to a hardware store to buy a cheap butane torch.
It turned out to be a normal cigarette lighter with a fancy nozzle.
It had issues staying lit, so I broiled the whole dish for &lt;em&gt;literally&lt;/em&gt; seconds and refroze it for a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a really good dessert, impressive looking too, but it ruined the party by making everyone tired.
Because of the extra time it took to make each component, I'd probably only make this again for special occassions.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>Adam Ragusea</category><category>cake</category><category>chocolate</category><category>dessert</category><category>ice cream</category><category>italian meringue</category><category>youtube</category><guid>https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/practical-baked-alaska/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 04 Jul 2022 12:06:52 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Ginger Spice Brownies and 2 Bowl Ice Cream</title><link>https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/ginger-spice-brownies-and-2-bowl-ice-cream/</link><dc:creator>Matt Anderson</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;My roommate's girlfriend makes a lot of chocolate desserts that he brings home to share with me.
She made some really good brownies which inspired me to return the favor.
However, I wanted to make it a little weirder, so I used Serious Eats' &lt;a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/ginger-spice-brownies-5216863"&gt;ginger spice brownies recipe&lt;/a&gt;.
This is a heavily spiced dessert akin to gingerbread.
The brownies are great with a complex flavor, but they ended up being cakier than I prefer.
The recipe calls for the cake to register at 210°F, which  may be the culprit, or perhaps too much flour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since it includes such intense flavors, I thought it would be nice to pair it with something fatty to balance it.
I took the opportunity to try Adam Ragusea's &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-SikBqk2PM"&gt;2 Bowl Ice Cream&lt;/a&gt; method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/p-SikBqk2PM" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a few problems with this method.
While I did incorporate a significant amount of air, I never got to stiff peaks while whipping the ice cream base.
I think that may be because I added too much milk, throwing off the fat to water ratio.
The base didn't deflate much on the second mixing either.
I also accidentally added peppermint extract instead of vanilla, so I had to pivot to a mint chocolate chip ice cream.
Luckily, the ginger spice brownies still go well with mint.
I ended up with 2 and a half quarts which was way more than I expected (probably due to the retained air).&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>Adam Ragusea</category><category>baking</category><category>brownies</category><category>ginger</category><category>ice cream</category><category>mint</category><category>mistake</category><category>Serious Eats</category><category>spice</category><category>youtube</category><guid>https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/ginger-spice-brownies-and-2-bowl-ice-cream/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 13 Jun 2022 01:17:45 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
