She requested that we have a fish fry which is something we used to do a lot growing up.
It would be a big potluck for the small river town that we spent a lot of time at.
The fishermen would catch a bunch of catfish, carp, and walleye and then spend all day frying them.
There would also be a ton of side dishes and lawn games.
It was a formative memory for all of us kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She also said she was bringing sweet corn and I had recently seen Kenji's video on &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zhe4xOaypO4"&gt;sweet corn elotes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I brought &lt;a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/two-minute-mayonnaise"&gt;homemade mayo&lt;/a&gt;, cotija cheese, and my popcorn spice blend.
The popcorn spice blend came from a New York Times article a long time ago, which is no longer available sadly.
I've forgotten the exact ratios, but it consists of paprika, cayenne, salt, garlic powder, and pepper.
It's basically a grilling spice blend such as Lawry's.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made the elotes just like in the video and it was amazing!
I think it's way better than just buttered corn.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>corn</category><category>family farm</category><category>grill</category><category>Kenji</category><category>mayo</category><category>Youtube</category><guid>https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/sweet-corn-elotes/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 20 Aug 2022 23:51:06 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Fried Cauliflower "Wings"</title><link>https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/fried-cauliflower-wings/</link><dc:creator>Matt Anderson</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;My roommate's girlfriend is pescatarian, so we try to find interesting dishes that accommodate her diet.
There is a great recipe for &lt;a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/the-vegan-experience-korean-fried-cauliflower"&gt;fried cauliflower "wings"&lt;/a&gt;.
It is good enough to rival real chicken wings.
The batter is extra crispy and the cauliflower perfectly tender.
There are recipes for a Buffalo sauce and a Korean sweet and spicy sauce.
I prefer the Korean sauce, but both are really good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also made some &lt;a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/ranch-dressing-homemade-recipe"&gt;ranch dressing&lt;/a&gt; which itself is based on a &lt;a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/two-minute-mayonnaise"&gt;homemade mayo&lt;/a&gt;.
That mayo is a staple in my house.
The ranch dressing is really amazing.
It's much better with fresh herbs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also made &lt;a href="https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/toaster-oven-salmon/"&gt;toaster oven salmon&lt;/a&gt; to round out the meal.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>Asian</category><category>cauliflower</category><category>deep fried</category><category>friends</category><category>ginger</category><category>Kenji</category><category>mayo</category><category>ranch</category><category>sauce</category><category>Serious Eats</category><category>soy</category><category>vegan</category><category>wings</category><guid>https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/fried-cauliflower-wings/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 18 Jul 2022 02:37:18 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Deviled Egg Salad</title><link>https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/deviled-egg-salad/</link><dc:creator>Matt Anderson</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;I little while ago I saw a video about various sandwich "salads" by Adam Ragusea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/wSn8Yzz_QbA" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I vaguely remembered the egg salad from that video and decided to make my own.
In particular, I remembered that his wife made a deviled egg style filling that the chopped whites get tossed in.
I hardboiled 4 eggs by simmering them in just enough water to cover for 14 minutes.
I threw together a deviled egg filling loosely inspired by &lt;a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/great-deviled-eggs-recipe"&gt;J. Kenji's deviled egg recipe&lt;/a&gt;.
My favorite part of this recipe is the addition of a high quality olive oil.
A peppery oil works very well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time I combined egg yolks, &lt;a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/two-minute-mayonnaise"&gt;homemade mayo&lt;/a&gt;, stone-ground mustard, capers, diced celery and its leaves, diced dill pickle, salt, pepper, cayenne, and paprika to create the base.
Then I whisked in some olive oil until it became a lighter consistency and added the chopped egg whites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I served the egg salad in a wrap with a few leaves of red oakleaf lettuce from my countertop aerogarden.
If you like deviled eggs, this is a great excuse to make a meal out of them.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>Adam Ragusea</category><category>capers</category><category>celery</category><category>egg</category><category>homegrown</category><category>lettuce</category><category>mayo</category><category>pickle</category><category>salad</category><category>sandwiches</category><category>wraps</category><category>Youtube</category><guid>https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/deviled-egg-salad/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 09 Jun 2022 13:43:25 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
