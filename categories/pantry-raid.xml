The braised pork interested me and I had some pork belly leftover from the &lt;a href="https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/pasta-carbonara/"&gt;pasta carbonara&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the spirit of the video, I also just threw some things together into a braise.
The spices I used were gochugaru (Korean chili powder), Szechuan peppercorns, and Chinese five spice powder.
The sauce was &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; flavorful, almost too much.
I served it with white rice, sliced scallions, and an egg fried in the pork fat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was very good and made me happy to use some leftovers.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>About To Eat</category><category>braise</category><category>gochugaru</category><category>pantry raid</category><category>peanut butter</category><category>pork belly</category><category>rice</category><category>Szechuan</category><category>Youtube</category><guid>https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/peanut-butter-braised-pork/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 29 Jul 2022 01:10:49 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Cauliflower Cake</title><link>https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/cauliflower-cake/</link><dc:creator>Matt Anderson</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;I had an extra head of cauliflower from the time we made &lt;a href="https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/fried-cauliflower-wings/"&gt;fried cauliflower "wings"&lt;/a&gt;.
I found a recipe for &lt;a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/cauliflower-cake-from-plenty-more"&gt;cauliflower cake&lt;/a&gt; that sounded interesting.
In essence you pre-cook some cauliflower, add it to a savory cake batter, and bake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key to this dish is the spices.
I had some home grown rosemary to cook the onion and garlic with which was really nice.
The recipe also calls for nigella seeds which I don't have.
I followed the recommendations from &lt;a href="https://www.thespruceeats.com/what-is-nigella-sativa-1763087"&gt;The Spruce Eats&lt;/a&gt; for substitutions.
I ended up using a combination of celery seeds, oregano, caraway seeds, cumin seeds, and onion powder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This batter uses a &lt;em&gt;ton&lt;/em&gt; of eggs as well.
That combined with the cheese makes the texture somewhere between a moist cake and a quiche.
This was actually a huge hit.
I highly recommend making this cake.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>cake</category><category>cauliflower</category><category>eggs</category><category>onion</category><category>pantry raid</category><category>rosemary</category><category>Serious Eats</category><guid>https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/cauliflower-cake/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 23 Jul 2022 18:52:54 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Pasta Carbonara</title><link>https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/pasta-carbonara/</link><dc:creator>Matt Anderson</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;I had some egg yolks left over from making &lt;a href="https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/homemade-klondike-bars/"&gt;homemade klondike bars&lt;/a&gt;, so I decided to make some pasta carbonara.
Traditionally, pasta carbonara is made with guanciale, cured pork jowl.
It is somewhat difficult to get in the United States and bacon or pork belly is often suggested as an alternative.
I used half a pound of peppered, cured pork belly diced and rendered until mostly crisp.
For the sauce, I combined the three leftover egg yolks, about 100 grams each of parmesan and pecorino romano cheese, a lot of cracked black pepper, and a drizzle of olive oil in a large bowl and mixed into a paste.
I also added a dash of milk leftover from the klondike bars to loosen the sauce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For cheese or oil based sauces, I like to cook my pasta in a small amount of water as shown in &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWaYdGQqxQU"&gt;this video for stovetop mac and cheese&lt;/a&gt; by J. Kenji Lopez-Alt.
This concentrates the starch in the water which helps emulsify the sauce.
Once the pasta is al dente, I drained most of the water and then tossed the pasta in the pan with the pork to emulsify the oil.
Then, I add the pasta and pork into the bowl with the sauce and vigorously toss it.
The residual heat in the pasta cooks the eggs to a custard-like consistency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pasta carbonara, cacio e pepe, and aglio e olio are all solid and quick pasta dishes that you should have at the ready.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>black pepper</category><category>egg yolk</category><category>Italian</category><category>pantry raid</category><category>parmesan</category><category>pasta</category><category>pecorino romano</category><category>pork belly</category><guid>https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/pasta-carbonara/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 22 Jul 2022 03:22:50 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Homemade Klondike Bars</title><link>https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/homemade-klondike-bars/</link><dc:creator>Matt Anderson</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;I had 6 egg whites left over from the &lt;a href="https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/thai-tea-cake-and-coconut-custard/"&gt;coconut custard&lt;/a&gt; I made recently.
My roommate and his girlfriend have also been eating Klondike bars a lot, so I decided to make a &lt;a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/homemade-klondike-ice-cream-bars-recipe"&gt;homemade version&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/kfb7bo0QCxs" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The "ice cream" is actually a combination of Swiss meringue (cooked, whipped egg whites with sugar) and whipped cream.
The texture is pretty much the same as the commercial bars.
The best part is that you can use quality chocolate which the original is severely lacking.
This recipe has a lot of leftover chocolate mixture, so I put some almonds in an icetray, covered them and froze it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This recipe is pretty easy if you have a stand mixer.
It may be bearable with a hand mixer too.
The main drawback is that you must freeze things repeatedly to avoid melting while you are coating with chocolate.
It's a nice way to use up some leftover egg whites.
Ironically, we scrambled the egg whites on accident while cooking the meringue, so now I have yolks leftover.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>chocolate</category><category>friends</category><category>ice cream</category><category>meringue</category><category>pantry raid</category><category>Serious Eats</category><category>stand mixer</category><category>Stella Parks</category><guid>https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/homemade-klondike-bars/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 18 Jul 2022 02:36:37 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Thai Tea Cake and Coconut Custard</title><link>https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/thai-tea-cake-and-coconut-custard/</link><dc:creator>Matt Anderson</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;I bought a pound of loose leaf Thai tea a while back because I really love Thai iced tea in restaurants.
For a while, I was making it all the time at home with various milks.
The drink is really good, but I wanted to find something else to try.
I found a &lt;a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/thai-tea-cake-with-condensed-milk-custard-sauce-recipe"&gt;Thai tea cake with custard recipe&lt;/a&gt;.
The cake is pretty straightforward, even though I had to buy a new pan.
You just steep the tea in some warm milk before incorporating into the cake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the custard, I couldn't find sweetened condensed milk, only sweetened condensed &lt;em&gt;coconut&lt;/em&gt; milk.
I felt that was perhaps a more fitting alternative anyway.
The custard was pretty standard as well.
However, it uses 6 egg yolks, so I didn't actually reduce my unused pantry ingredients with all the extra egg whites sitting around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a really great desert.
The cake becomes a nice orange color and the coconut custard awesome.
I only wish that the tea flavor were stronger.
You have to eat the cake without any custard to get any hint of tea.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>cake</category><category>coconut</category><category>custard</category><category>pantry raid</category><category>Serious Eats</category><category>tea</category><category>Thai</category><guid>https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/thai-tea-cake-and-coconut-custard/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 18 Jul 2022 02:35:39 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Pumpkin Sweet Swirl Buns</title><link>https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/pumpkin-sweet-swirl-buns/</link><dc:creator>Matt Anderson</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;In my last post, I made a &lt;a href="https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/pumpkin-skillet-coffee-cake/"&gt;pumpkin coffee cake&lt;/a&gt; that left me with a decent amount of opened pumpkin puree.
So, in an attempt to use it before it goes bad, I made &lt;a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/pumpkin-sweet-swirl-buns"&gt;pumpkin sweet swirl buns&lt;/a&gt; (similar to cinnamon buns).
I didn't have graham crackers, so I ground up a crunchy granola bar that aready had pimpkin seeds in it.
I also had to grind hazelnuts into a meal which is a bit tricky not to turn into nut butter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This used almost all of the remaining puree which is great. 
It also let me use my stand mixer to knead the dough.
I'm glad for any chance to use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first, I was afraid I didn't roll the dough tight enough to get a good swirl.
However, the overnight proof in the fridge filled in the gaps.
I also made a cream cheese frosting by whipping cream cheese, lemon juice, vanilla extract, and powdered sugar together.
You can add a little bit of water to thin it out to your desired consistency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The buns were really good!
They were perfectly fluffy, a nice shade of orange, and the hazelnut filling was a perfect match for the spices.
My only (minor) complaint is that the pumpkin flavor was not strong enough.
I think the best takeaway is to try other fillings for cinnamon rolls.
The dough is just a fluffy, yeasty, buttery vehicle for the filling.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>hazelnut</category><category>pantry raid</category><category>pumpkin</category><category>Serious Eats</category><guid>https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/pumpkin-sweet-swirl-buns/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 09 Jul 2022 23:19:01 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Pumpkin Skillet Coffee Cake</title><link>https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/pumpkin-skillet-coffee-cake/</link><dc:creator>Matt Anderson</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;On occasion I will scour the internet for recipes to use up an indegredient I have too much of (see the &lt;a href="https://maxb2.github.io/food/categories/pantry-raid/"&gt; pantry raid&lt;/a&gt; tag).
This time I was looking for old-fashioned oatmeal recipes, but it led me to another unused ingredient, pureed pumpkin.
I originally bought it when I was experimenting with a low-carb diet and didn't really like it in less sweet applications. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Serendipitously, a &lt;a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/pumpkin-skillet-coffeecake-with-streusel-topping"&gt;pumpkin skillet coffee cake with oatmeal streusel&lt;/a&gt; could use both of these ingredients.
I really liked this cake, especially the texture that the white chocolate adds.
I didn't have any pecans, so I replaced them with some walnuts and pepitas (green pumpkin seeds).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, this only used a fraction of each ingredient.
It didn't even use the whole can of pureed pumpkin that I opened.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>cake</category><category>coffee</category><category>pantry raid</category><category>pumpkin</category><category>Serious Eats</category><category>skillet</category><guid>https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/pumpkin-skillet-coffee-cake/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 09 Jul 2022 14:51:30 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Watermelon Gazpacho</title><link>https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/watermelon-gazpacho/</link><dc:creator>Matt Anderson</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;The Independence Day gathering that I brought the &lt;a href="https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/practical-baked-alaska/"&gt;Baked Alaska&lt;/a&gt; to was a potluck.
The host made a really good watermelon, spinach, parmesan, and Balsamic vinagrette salad.
The watermelon they bought was &lt;em&gt;huge&lt;/em&gt;, so they sent me home with half of it.
I found a &lt;a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/watermelon-gazpacho-with-calabrian-chili-crema"&gt;watermelon gazpacho recipe&lt;/a&gt; to try to use it all up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I couldn't find Calabrian chilis, so I just used some serranos.
I also found that it needed much more vinegar than the recipe called for.
Actually, it was quite hard to season the fresh soup, probably because it was cold and the flavors needed to mingle.
It turned out really well after resting in the fridge though.
This made me really appreciate the spicy watermelon combo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still have way too much frozen watermelon leftover though...&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>gazpacho</category><category>pantry raid</category><category>Serious Eats</category><category>soup</category><category>watermelon</category><guid>https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/watermelon-gazpacho/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 07 Jul 2022 01:30:21 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Mapo Tofu</title><link>https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/mapo-tofu/</link><dc:creator>Matt Anderson</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dElALuJ9Xo8"&gt;J. Kenji's non-traditional mapo tofu video&lt;/a&gt; brought this dish to my attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dElALuJ9Xo8" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He uses Japanese flavors to make something similar to the original dish.
As he was discussing the traditional ingredients and why he was replacing them, I realized that I could get somewhat close to the original dish with what I had on hand.
I still had to make some substitutions, but I wasn't trying to alter the fundamental flavors that much.
Luckily, Kenji also has a &lt;a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/real-deal-mapo-dofu-tofu-chinese-sichuan-recipe"&gt;"real-deal" mapo tofu recipe&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I replaced:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Xiaoxing wine with a mixture of dry Sherry and sake.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chicken stock with beef boullion (I didn't want to thaw a quart to use 1/4 cup).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Black bean paste with gochujang (Korean chili and bean paste).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Roasted chili oil with my &lt;a href="https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/spicy-chili-crisp-gifts/"&gt;chili crisp&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also reduced the amount of Sichuan peppercorns by half because the chili crisp already has some in it.
For that reason, I only toasted and fried the peppercorns rather than grind them and add it back to the final dish.
I felt like it was a reasonable step to take out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ran into a few problems making this dish.
First, I used too much oil, so it was hard to emulsify into a sauce.
I ended up adding twice the corn starch slurry and the sauce still broke easily when it cooled down.
Even though I added no extra salt, this dish was &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; salty.
The chili crisp and gochujang are fairly salty, but I think I added too much beef boullion for the 1/4 cup stock I was supposed to use.
To fix this problem, I served the mapo tofu with unsalted, buttered rice to dilute the salt.
The final issue is that there was not enough heat or numbing (the málà flavor).
I wish that I had included more Sichuan peppercorns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's still a really good dish that I want to try again.
Hopefully next time it will be strong enough to really activate some endorphins.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>beef</category><category>garlic</category><category>ginger</category><category>pantry raid</category><category>rice</category><category>Serious Eats</category><category>Sichuan</category><category>spicy</category><category>tofu</category><guid>https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/mapo-tofu/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 30 May 2022 13:30:38 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Stuffed Cabbage Rolls (Golubtsi)</title><link>https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/stuffed-cabbage-rolls-golubtsi/</link><dc:creator>Matt Anderson</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;I recently saw &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/helenrennie"&gt;Helen Rennie's&lt;/a&gt; video for stuffed cabbage rolls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/HmtK5er6GSc" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I love cabbage, I really wanted to try it.
I have a few pounds of ground deer meat that I got from a hunter friend, so I replaced the veal in the meatloaf mix with deer.
I also used the optional gelatin as a safegaurd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trimming the stems of the cabbage leaves was a great way to increase the flexibility of the leaves.
The filling was still a bit too crumbly at the end.
I could add more binders to the mix (breadcrumbs and eggs), and/or knead the mixture more to get it tighter.
My sauce also didn't reduce much during the braise, but that is not a problem when serving the rolls browned as suggested in the video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of steps in the process, but it felt very manageable with two people.
One of us focused on the cabbage and sauce while the other focused on the filling and forming of the rolls.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>beef</category><category>cabbage</category><category>carrot</category><category>deer</category><category>golubtsi</category><category>Helen Rennie</category><category>meatloaf</category><category>pantry raid</category><category>rice</category><category>stuffed</category><category>tomato</category><category>Youtube</category><guid>https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/stuffed-cabbage-rolls-golubtsi/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 29 May 2022 22:50:18 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
