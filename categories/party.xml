Sujeonggwa is a cinnamon and ginger punch which is typically flavored with &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sujeonggwa"&gt;dried persimmon&lt;/a&gt;.
The recipe I followed suggested apple chips as an easier to find substitute.
The drink was extremely good both hot and cold (the traditional way).
The best way I can describe the flavor is a spicy (from the ginger) brown sugar cinnamon pop-tart.
The pine nuts were my favorite part as they added texture and complemented the spices' flavor perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was also perfect timing because my friend hosted a dumpling making party the day after I made the punch.
I brought it and some apple jack to make a simple fall cocktail.
The party was a ton of fun!
I got to practice my dumpling making skills, share some drinks and even bring some dumplings home.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>apple</category><category>cinnamon</category><category>cocktail</category><category>drinks</category><category>dumplings</category><category>ginger</category><category>korean</category><category>party</category><category>punch</category><category>Serious Eats</category><guid>https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/apple-sujeonggwa/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 01 Oct 2022 18:18:26 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
