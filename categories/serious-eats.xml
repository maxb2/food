I found a recipe for &lt;a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/cauliflower-cake-from-plenty-more"&gt;cauliflower cake&lt;/a&gt; that sounded interesting.
In essence you pre-cook some cauliflower, add it to a savory cake batter, and bake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key to this dish is the spices.
I had some home grown rosemary to cook the onion and garlic with which was really nice.
The recipe also calls for nigella seeds which I don't have.
I followed the recommendations from &lt;a href="https://www.thespruceeats.com/what-is-nigella-sativa-1763087"&gt;The Spruce Eats&lt;/a&gt; for substitutions.
I ended up using a combination of celery seeds, oregano, caraway seeds, cumin seeds, and onion powder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This batter uses a &lt;em&gt;ton&lt;/em&gt; of eggs as well.
That combined with the cheese makes the texture somewhere between a moist cake and a quiche.
This was actually a huge hit.
I highly recommend making this cake.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>cake</category><category>cauliflower</category><category>eggs</category><category>onion</category><category>pantry-raid</category><category>rosemary</category><category>Serious Eats</category><guid>https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/cauliflower-cake/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 23 Jul 2022 18:52:54 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Fried Cauliflower "Wings"</title><link>https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/fried-cauliflower-wings/</link><dc:creator>Matt Anderson</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;My roommate's girlfriend is pescatarian, so we try to find interesting dishes that accommodate her diet.
There is a great recipe for &lt;a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/the-vegan-experience-korean-fried-cauliflower"&gt;fried cauliflower "wings"&lt;/a&gt;.
It is good enough to rival real chicken wings.
The batter is extra crispy and the cauliflower perfectly tender.
There are recipes for a Buffalo sauce and a Korean sweet and spicy sauce.
I prefer the Korean sauce, but both are really good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also made some &lt;a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/ranch-dressing-homemade-recipe"&gt;ranch dressing&lt;/a&gt; which itself is based on a &lt;a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/two-minute-mayonnaise"&gt;homemade mayo&lt;/a&gt;.
That mayo is a staple in my house.
The ranch dressing is really amazing.
It's much better with fresh herbs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also made &lt;a href="https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/toaster-oven-salmon/"&gt;toaster oven salmon&lt;/a&gt; to round out the meal.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>Asian</category><category>cauliflower</category><category>deep fried</category><category>friends</category><category>ginger</category><category>Kenji</category><category>mayo</category><category>ranch</category><category>sauce</category><category>Serious Eats</category><category>soy</category><category>vegan</category><category>wings</category><guid>https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/fried-cauliflower-wings/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 18 Jul 2022 02:37:18 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Toaster Oven Salmon</title><link>https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/toaster-oven-salmon/</link><dc:creator>Matt Anderson</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;While making &lt;a href="https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/fried-cauliflower-wings/"&gt;fried cauliflower "wings"&lt;/a&gt;, we made &lt;a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/miso-glazed-salmon-in-the-toaster-oven-recipe"&gt;toaster oven salmon&lt;/a&gt;.
For the marinade I just threw together some miso, soy sauce, brown sugar, and rice vinegar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think my toaster oven is a bit underpowered, as it took much longer than the recipe suggested.
In principle though, I really enjoy the salmon covered in a marinade or flavored mayo and broiled.
The oil coating in both cases insulates the fish from the heat so as not to dry out.
Plus, the coating can get a nice browning.
I also make &lt;a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/baked-broiled-salmon-harissa-mayonnaise"&gt;broiled salmon with harissa spice mayo&lt;/a&gt; quite often.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>friends</category><category>Kenji</category><category>miso</category><category>rice vinegar</category><category>salmon</category><category>Serious Eats</category><category>soy</category><category>toaster oven</category><guid>https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/toaster-oven-salmon/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 18 Jul 2022 02:36:54 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Homemade Klondike Bars</title><link>https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/homemade-klondike-bars/</link><dc:creator>Matt Anderson</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;I had 6 egg whites left over from the &lt;a href="https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/thai-tea-cake-and-coconut-custard/"&gt;coconut custard&lt;/a&gt; I made recently.
My roommate and his girlfriend have also been eating Klondike bars a lot, so I decided to make a &lt;a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/homemade-klondike-ice-cream-bars-recipe"&gt;homemade version&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/kfb7bo0QCxs" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The "ice cream" is actually a combination of Swiss meringue (cooked, whipped egg whites with sugar) and whipped cream.
The texture is pretty much the same as the commercial bars.
The best part is that you can use quality chocolate which the original is severely lacking.
This recipe has a lot of leftover chocolate mixture, so I put some almonds in an icetray, covered them and froze it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This recipe is pretty easy if you have a stand mixer.
It may be bearable with a hand mixer too.
The main drawback is that you must freeze things repeatedly to avoid melting while you are coating with chocolate.
It's a nice way to use up some leftover egg whites.
Ironically, we scrambled the egg whites on accident while cooking the meringue, so now I have yolks leftover.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>chocolate</category><category>friends</category><category>ice cream</category><category>meringue</category><category>pantry-raid</category><category>Serious Eats</category><category>stand mixer</category><category>Stella Parks</category><guid>https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/homemade-klondike-bars/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 18 Jul 2022 02:36:37 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Thai Tea Cake and Coconut Custard</title><link>https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/thai-tea-cake-and-coconut-custard/</link><dc:creator>Matt Anderson</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;I bought a pound of loose leaf Thai tea a while back because I really love Thai iced tea in restaurants.
For a while, I was making it all the time at home with various milks.
The drink is really good, but I wanted to find something else to try.
I found a &lt;a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/thai-tea-cake-with-condensed-milk-custard-sauce-recipe"&gt;Thai tea cake with custard recipe&lt;/a&gt;.
The cake is pretty straightforward, even though I had to buy a new pan.
You just steep the tea in some warm milk before incorporating into the cake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the custard, I couldn't find sweetened condensed milk, only sweetened condensed &lt;em&gt;coconut&lt;/em&gt; milk.
I felt that was perhaps a more fitting alternative anyway.
The custard was pretty standard as well.
However, it uses 6 egg yolks, so I didn't actually reduce my unused pantry ingredients with all the extra egg whites sitting around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a really great desert.
The cake becomes a nice orange color and the coconut custard awesome.
I only wish that the tea flavor were stronger.
You have to eat the cake without any custard to get any hint of tea.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>cake</category><category>coconut</category><category>custard</category><category>pantry-raid</category><category>Serious Eats</category><category>tea</category><category>Thai</category><guid>https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/thai-tea-cake-and-coconut-custard/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 18 Jul 2022 02:35:39 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Pumpkin Sweet Swirl Buns</title><link>https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/pumpkin-sweet-swirl-buns/</link><dc:creator>Matt Anderson</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;In my last post, I made a &lt;a href="https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/pumpkin-skillet-coffee-cake/"&gt;pumpkin coffee cake&lt;/a&gt; that left me with a decent amount of opened pumpkin puree.
So, in an attempt to use it before it goes bad, I made &lt;a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/pumpkin-sweet-swirl-buns"&gt;pumpkin sweet swirl buns&lt;/a&gt; (similar to cinnamon buns).
I didn't have graham crackers, so I ground up a crunchy granola bar that aready had pimpkin seeds in it.
I also had to grind hazelnuts into a meal which is a bit tricky not to turn into nut butter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This used almost all of the remaining puree which is great. 
It also let me use my stand mixer to knead the dough.
I'm glad for any chance to use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first, I was afraid I didn't roll the dough tight enough to get a good swirl.
However, the overnight proof in the fridge filled in the gaps.
I also made a cream cheese frosting by whipping cream cheese, lemon juice, vanilla extract, and powdered sugar together.
You can add a little bit of water to thin it out to your desired consistency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The buns were really good!
They were perfectly fluffy, a nice shade of orange, and the hazelnut filling was a perfect match for the spices.
My only (minor) complaint is that the pumpkin flavor was not strong enough.
I think the best takeaway is to try other fillings for cinnamon rolls.
The dough is just a fluffy, yeasty, buttery vehicle for the filling.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>hazelnut</category><category>pantry-raid</category><category>pumpkin</category><category>Serious Eats</category><guid>https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/pumpkin-sweet-swirl-buns/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 09 Jul 2022 23:19:01 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Pumpkin Skillet Coffee Cake</title><link>https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/pumpkin-skillet-coffee-cake/</link><dc:creator>Matt Anderson</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;On occasion I will scour the internet for recipes to use up an indegredient I have too much of (see the &lt;a href="https://maxb2.github.io/food/categories/pantry-raid/"&gt;pantry-raid&lt;/a&gt; tag).
This time I was looking for old-fashioned oatmeal recipes, but it led me to another unused ingredient, pureed pumpkin.
I originally bought it when I was experimenting with a low-carb diet and didn't really like it in less sweet applications. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Serendipitously, a &lt;a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/pumpkin-skillet-coffeecake-with-streusel-topping"&gt;pumpkin skillet coffee cake with oatmeal streusel&lt;/a&gt; could use both of these ingredients.
I really liked this cake, especially the texture that the white chocolate adds.
I didn't have any pecans, so I replaced them with some walnuts and pepitas (green pumpkin seeds).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, this only used a fraction of each ingredient.
It didn't even use the whole can of pureed pumpkin that I opened.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>cake</category><category>coffee</category><category>pantry-raid</category><category>pumpkin</category><category>Serious Eats</category><category>skillet</category><guid>https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/pumpkin-skillet-coffee-cake/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 09 Jul 2022 14:51:30 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Watermelon Gazpacho</title><link>https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/watermelon-gazpacho/</link><dc:creator>Matt Anderson</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;The Independence Day gathering that I brought the &lt;a href="https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/practical-baked-alaska/"&gt;Baked Alaska&lt;/a&gt; to was a potluck.
The host made a really good watermelon, spinach, parmesan, and Balsamic vinagrette salad.
The watermelon they bought was &lt;em&gt;huge&lt;/em&gt;, so they sent me home with half of it.
I found a &lt;a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/watermelon-gazpacho-with-calabrian-chili-crema"&gt;watermelon gazpacho recipe&lt;/a&gt; to try to use it all up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I couldn't find Calabrian chilis, so I just used some serranos.
I also found that it needed much more vinegar than the recipe called for.
Actually, it was quite hard to season the fresh soup, probably because it was cold and the flavors needed to mingle.
It turned out really well after resting in the fridge though.
This made me really appreciate the spicy watermelon combo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still have way too much frozen watermelon leftover though...&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>gazpacho</category><category>pantry-raid</category><category>Serious Eats</category><category>soup</category><category>watermelon</category><guid>https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/watermelon-gazpacho/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 07 Jul 2022 01:30:21 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Masa Ball Soup and Champurrado</title><link>https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/masa-ball-soup-and-champurrado/</link><dc:creator>Matt Anderson</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;When I was researching the &lt;a href="https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/schmaltz-garlic-confit-and-matzo-ball-soup/"&gt;matzo ball soup&lt;/a&gt;, I came across something amusing: &lt;a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/how-to-make-masa-ball-soup-mexican-jewish-matzo-corn"&gt;Masa ball soup&lt;/a&gt;.
It's a Mexican take on the original dish. 
Both are essentially dumplings in chicken soup.
The dumplings here are made of masa, a specially treated corn flour used in tortillas, tamales, etc.
The last minor differences are using squash and cilantro instead of carrots and dill.
It's those changes that give the dish a Mexican flavor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The masa ball dough was pretty loose which made me fear that the balls would disintegrate while cooking.
Fortunately, they stayed together despite being a bit deformed.
Overall, this was the best tasting pun I've eaten, but I prefer the original a little more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I had the masa flour out, I decided to try making &lt;a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/champurrado-mexican-hot-chocolate-corn-drink-recipe"&gt;champurrado&lt;/a&gt;, a thickened hot chocolate drink.
I felt like the recipe was a bit lacking, so I added some cayenne, cumin, and coriander.
It was pretty good, but not the right time of year for hot chocolate.
One plus is that it sets up as a pudding when cooled which fit the season better.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>champurrado</category><category>chocolate</category><category>masa</category><category>matzo</category><category>pudding</category><category>pun</category><category>Serious Eats</category><category>soup</category><guid>https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/masa-ball-soup-and-champurrado/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 02 Jul 2022 22:32:43 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Ginger Spice Brownies and 2 Bowl Ice Cream</title><link>https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/ginger-spice-brownies-and-2-bowl-ice-cream/</link><dc:creator>Matt Anderson</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;My roommate's girlfriend makes a lot of chocolate desserts that he brings home to share with me.
She made some really good brownies which inspired me to return the favor.
However, I wanted to make it a little weirder, so I used Serious Eats' &lt;a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/ginger-spice-brownies-5216863"&gt;ginger spice brownies recipe&lt;/a&gt;.
This is a heavily spiced dessert akin to gingerbread.
The brownies are great with a complex flavor, but they ended up being cakier than I prefer.
The recipe calls for the cake to register at 210Â°F, which  may be the culprit, or perhaps too much flour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since it includes such intense flavors, I thought it would be nice to pair it with something fatty to balance it.
I took the opportunity to try Adam Ragusea's &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-SikBqk2PM"&gt;2 Bowl Ice Cream&lt;/a&gt; method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/p-SikBqk2PM" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a few problems with this method.
While I did incorporate a significant amount of air, I never got to stiff peaks while whipping the ice cream base.
I think that may be because I added too much milk, throwing off the fat to water ratio.
The base didn't deflate much on the second mixing either.
I also accidentally added peppermint extract instead of vanilla, so I had to pivot to a mint chocolate chip ice cream.
Luckily, the ginger spice brownies still go well with mint.
I ended up with 2 and a half quarts which was way more than I expected (probably due to the retained air).&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>Adam Ragusea</category><category>baking</category><category>brownies</category><category>ginger</category><category>ice cream</category><category>mint</category><category>mistake</category><category>Serious Eats</category><category>spice</category><category>youtube</category><guid>https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/ginger-spice-brownies-and-2-bowl-ice-cream/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 13 Jun 2022 01:17:45 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
