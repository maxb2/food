My roommate and his girlfriend have also been eating Klondike bars a lot, so I decided to make a &lt;a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/homemade-klondike-ice-cream-bars-recipe"&gt;homemade version&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/kfb7bo0QCxs" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The "ice cream" is actually a combination of Swiss meringue (cooked, whipped egg whites with sugar) and whipped cream.
The texture is pretty much the same as the commercial bars.
The best part is that you can use quality chocolate which the original is severely lacking.
This recipe has a lot of leftover chocolate mixture, so I put some almonds in an icetray, covered them and froze it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This recipe is pretty easy if you have a stand mixer.
It may be bearable with a hand mixer too.
The main drawback is that you must freeze things repeatedly to avoid melting while you are coating with chocolate.
It's a nice way to use up some leftover egg whites.
Ironically, we scrambled the egg whites on accident while cooking the meringue, so now I have yolks leftover.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>chocolate</category><category>friends</category><category>ice cream</category><category>meringue</category><category>pantry-raid</category><category>Serious Eats</category><category>stand mixer</category><category>Stella Parks</category><guid>https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/homemade-klondike-bars/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 18 Jul 2022 02:36:37 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Thai Tea Cake and Coconut Custard</title><link>https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/thai-tea-cake-and-coconut-custard/</link><dc:creator>Matt Anderson</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;I bought a pound of loose leaf Thai tea a while back because I really love Thai iced tea in restaurants.
For a while, I was making it all the time at home with various milks.
The drink is really good, but I wanted to find something else to try.
I found a &lt;a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/thai-tea-cake-with-condensed-milk-custard-sauce-recipe"&gt;Thai tea cake with custard recipe&lt;/a&gt;.
The cake is pretty straightforward, even though I had to buy a new pan.
You just steep the tea in some warm milk before incorporating into the cake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the custard, I couldn't find sweetened condensed milk, only sweetened condensed &lt;em&gt;coconut&lt;/em&gt; milk.
I felt that was perhaps a more fitting alternative anyway.
The custard was pretty standard as well.
However, it uses 6 egg yolks, so I didn't actually reduce my unused pantry ingredients with all the extra egg whites sitting around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a really great desert.
The cake becomes a nice orange color and the coconut custard awesome.
I only wish that the tea flavor were stronger.
You have to eat the cake without any custard to get any hint of tea.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>cake</category><category>coconut</category><category>custard</category><category>pantry-raid</category><category>Serious Eats</category><category>tea</category><category>Thai</category><guid>https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/thai-tea-cake-and-coconut-custard/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 18 Jul 2022 02:35:39 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Pumpkin Sweet Swirl Buns</title><link>https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/pumpkin-sweet-swirl-buns/</link><dc:creator>Matt Anderson</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;In my last post, I made a &lt;a href="https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/pumpkin-skillet-coffee-cake/"&gt;pumpkin coffee cake&lt;/a&gt; that left me with a decent amount of opened pumpkin puree.
So, in an attempt to use it before it goes bad, I made &lt;a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/pumpkin-sweet-swirl-buns"&gt;pumpkin sweet swirl buns&lt;/a&gt; (similar to cinnamon buns).
I didn't have graham crackers, so I ground up a crunchy granola bar that aready had pimpkin seeds in it.
I also had to grind hazelnuts into a meal which is a bit tricky not to turn into nut butter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This used almost all of the remaining puree which is great. 
It also let me use my stand mixer to knead the dough.
I'm glad for any chance to use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first, I was afraid I didn't roll the dough tight enough to get a good swirl.
However, the overnight proof in the fridge filled in the gaps.
I also made a cream cheese frosting by whipping cream cheese, lemon juice, vanilla extract, and powdered sugar together.
You can add a little bit of water to thin it out to your desired consistency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The buns were really good!
They were perfectly fluffy, a nice shade of orange, and the hazelnut filling was a perfect match for the spices.
My only (minor) complaint is that the pumpkin flavor was not strong enough.
I think the best takeaway is to try other fillings for cinnamon rolls.
The dough is just a fluffy, yeasty, buttery vehicle for the filling.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>hazelnut</category><category>pantry-raid</category><category>pumpkin</category><category>Serious Eats</category><guid>https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/pumpkin-sweet-swirl-buns/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 09 Jul 2022 23:19:01 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Pumpkin Skillet Coffee Cake</title><link>https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/pumpkin-skillet-coffee-cake/</link><dc:creator>Matt Anderson</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;On occasion I will scour the internet for recipes to use up an indegredient I have too much of (see the &lt;a href="https://maxb2.github.io/food/categories/pantry-raid/"&gt;pantry-raid&lt;/a&gt; tag).
This time I was looking for old-fashioned oatmeal recipes, but it led me to another unused ingredient, pureed pumpkin.
I originally bought it when I was experimenting with a low-carb diet and didn't really like it in less sweet applications. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Serendipitously, a &lt;a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/pumpkin-skillet-coffeecake-with-streusel-topping"&gt;pumpkin skillet coffee cake with oatmeal streusel&lt;/a&gt; could use both of these ingredients.
I really liked this cake, especially the texture that the white chocolate adds.
I didn't have any pecans, so I replaced them with some walnuts and pepitas (green pumpkin seeds).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, this only used a fraction of each ingredient.
It didn't even use the whole can of pureed pumpkin that I opened.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>cake</category><category>coffee</category><category>pantry-raid</category><category>pumpkin</category><category>Serious Eats</category><category>skillet</category><guid>https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/pumpkin-skillet-coffee-cake/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 09 Jul 2022 14:51:30 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Watermelon Gazpacho</title><link>https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/watermelon-gazpacho/</link><dc:creator>Matt Anderson</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;The Independence Day gathering that I brought the &lt;a href="https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/practical-baked-alaska/"&gt;Baked Alaska&lt;/a&gt; to was a potluck.
The host made a really good watermelon, spinach, parmesan, and Balsamic vinagrette salad.
The watermelon they bought was &lt;em&gt;huge&lt;/em&gt;, so they sent me home with half of it.
I found a &lt;a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/watermelon-gazpacho-with-calabrian-chili-crema"&gt;watermelon gazpacho recipe&lt;/a&gt; to try to use it all up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I couldn't find Calabrian chilis, so I just used some serranos.
I also found that it needed much more vinegar than the recipe called for.
Actually, it was quite hard to season the fresh soup, probably because it was cold and the flavors needed to mingle.
It turned out really well after resting in the fridge though.
This made me really appreciate the spicy watermelon combo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still have way too much frozen watermelon leftover though...&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>gazpacho</category><category>pantry-raid</category><category>Serious Eats</category><category>soup</category><category>watermelon</category><guid>https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/watermelon-gazpacho/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 07 Jul 2022 01:30:21 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Masa Ball Soup and Champurrado</title><link>https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/masa-ball-soup-and-champurrado/</link><dc:creator>Matt Anderson</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;When I was researching the &lt;a href="https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/schmaltz-garlic-confit-and-matzo-ball-soup/"&gt;matzo ball soup&lt;/a&gt;, I came across something amusing: &lt;a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/how-to-make-masa-ball-soup-mexican-jewish-matzo-corn"&gt;Masa ball soup&lt;/a&gt;.
It's a Mexican take on the original dish. 
Both are essentially dumplings in chicken soup.
The dumplings here are made of masa, a specially treated corn flour used in tortillas, tamales, etc.
The last minor differences are using squash and cilantro instead of carrots and dill.
It's those changes that give the dish a Mexican flavor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The masa ball dough was pretty loose which made me fear that the balls would disintegrate while cooking.
Fortunately, they stayed together despite being a bit deformed.
Overall, this was the best tasting pun I've eaten, but I prefer the original a little more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I had the masa flour out, I decided to try making &lt;a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/champurrado-mexican-hot-chocolate-corn-drink-recipe"&gt;champurrado&lt;/a&gt;, a thickened hot chocolate drink.
I felt like the recipe was a bit lacking, so I added some cayenne, cumin, and coriander.
It was pretty good, but not the right time of year for hot chocolate.
One plus is that it sets up as a pudding when cooled which fit the season better.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>champurrado</category><category>chocolate</category><category>masa</category><category>matzo</category><category>pudding</category><category>pun</category><category>Serious Eats</category><category>soup</category><guid>https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/masa-ball-soup-and-champurrado/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 02 Jul 2022 22:32:43 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Ginger Spice Brownies and 2 Bowl Ice Cream</title><link>https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/ginger-spice-brownies-and-2-bowl-ice-cream/</link><dc:creator>Matt Anderson</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;My roommate's girlfriend makes a lot of chocolate desserts that he brings home to share with me.
She made some really good brownies which inspired me to return the favor.
However, I wanted to make it a little weirder, so I used Serious Eats' &lt;a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/ginger-spice-brownies-5216863"&gt;ginger spice brownies recipe&lt;/a&gt;.
This is a heavily spiced dessert akin to gingerbread.
The brownies are great with a complex flavor, but they ended up being cakier than I prefer.
The recipe calls for the cake to register at 210°F, which  may be the culprit, or perhaps too much flour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since it includes such intense flavors, I thought it would be nice to pair it with something fatty to balance it.
I took the opportunity to try Adam Ragusea's &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-SikBqk2PM"&gt;2 Bowl Ice Cream&lt;/a&gt; method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/p-SikBqk2PM" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a few problems with this method.
While I did incorporate a significant amount of air, I never got to stiff peaks while whipping the ice cream base.
I think that may be because I added too much milk, throwing off the fat to water ratio.
The base didn't deflate much on the second mixing either.
I also accidentally added peppermint extract instead of vanilla, so I had to pivot to a mint chocolate chip ice cream.
Luckily, the ginger spice brownies still go well with mint.
I ended up with 2 and a half quarts which was way more than I expected (probably due to the retained air).&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>Adam Ragusea</category><category>baking</category><category>brownies</category><category>ginger</category><category>ice cream</category><category>mint</category><category>mistake</category><category>Serious Eats</category><category>spice</category><category>youtube</category><guid>https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/ginger-spice-brownies-and-2-bowl-ice-cream/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 13 Jun 2022 01:17:45 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Shrimp Étouffée</title><link>https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/shrimp-etouffee/</link><dc:creator>Matt Anderson</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;In 2017 I visited New Orleans for a work conference.
On my last day there, I had crawfish étouffée for the first time.
It was so good that it made a lasting impression on me.
Last year, I tried the crawfish étouffée from a new-ish Cajun restaurant where I live.
Unfortunately, I was not impressed.
To be fair, it was not bad, I was just comparing it to a rose-tinted memory of a dish made by the actual authorities on the dish.
Nonetheless, the experience inspired me to make étouffée myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used the Serious Eats recipe for &lt;a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/shrimp-etouffee"&gt;shrimp étouffée&lt;/a&gt; since it's a bit difficult to get crawfish where I live.
It consists of two major operations: making a shrimp stock and making the étouffée itself.
The base of the stock is made from the shells of the shrimp used later in the main dish.
It is a relatively quick stock since you are only extracting flavor and not gelatin like a bone-based stock or broth.
However, it still helps to split the two operations up in time.
The recipe also makes enough stock for two batches of étouffée.
So, I froze one quart for a future use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of which brings us to the present day where I was searching for something to make and remembered the special purpose shrimp stock that had been in my freezer for a year. 
Making the étouffée itself is pretty simple, it's just make a roux, sweat some &lt;a href="https://www.thespruceeats.com/cajun-trinity-of-cooking-3052290"&gt;Cajun trinity vegetables&lt;/a&gt;, add spices and the stock, simmer until vegetables are soft, and cook your meat in the sauce.
In my opinion, the most impactful step is making the roux.
I like a "peanut butter" colored roux because it adds a complex, nutty flavor without overshadowing the other flavors.
This time, I also added some home grown garlic scapes as a garnish.
Finally, serve with rice and a dry white wine.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>butter</category><category>Cajun</category><category>cayenne</category><category>celery</category><category>Creole</category><category>etouffee</category><category>homegrown</category><category>pepper</category><category>rice</category><category>roux</category><category>Serious Eats</category><category>shrimp</category><guid>https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/shrimp-etouffee/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 13 Jun 2022 01:16:47 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Mapo Tofu</title><link>https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/mapo-tofu/</link><dc:creator>Matt Anderson</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dElALuJ9Xo8"&gt;J. Kenji's non-traditional mapo tofu video&lt;/a&gt; brought this dish to my attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dElALuJ9Xo8" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He uses Japanese flavors to make something similar to the original dish.
As he was discussing the traditional ingredients and why he was replacing them, I realized that I could get somewhat close to the original dish with what I had on hand.
I still had to make some substitutions, but I wasn't trying to alter the fundamental flavors that much.
Luckily, Kenji also has a &lt;a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/real-deal-mapo-dofu-tofu-chinese-sichuan-recipe"&gt;"real-deal" mapo tofu recipe&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I replaced:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Xiaoxing wine with a mixture of dry Sherry and sake.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chicken stock with beef boullion (I didn't want to thaw a quart to use 1/4 cup).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Black bean paste with gochujang (Korean chili and bean paste).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Roasted chili oil with my &lt;a href="https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/spicy-chili-crisp-gifts/"&gt;chili crisp&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also reduced the amount of Sichuan peppercorns by half because the chili crisp already has some in it.
For that reason, I only toasted and fried the peppercorns rather than grind them and add it back to the final dish.
I felt like it was a reasonable step to take out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ran into a few problems making this dish.
First, I used too much oil, so it was hard to emulsify into a sauce.
I ended up adding twice the corn starch slurry and the sauce still broke easily when it cooled down.
Even though I added no extra salt, this dish was &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; salty.
The chili crisp and gochujang are fairly salty, but I think I added too much beef boullion for the 1/4 cup stock I was supposed to use.
To fix this problem, I served the mapo tofu with unsalted, buttered rice to dilute the salt.
The final issue is that there was not enough heat or numbing (the málà flavor).
I wish that I had included more Sichuan peppercorns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's still a really good dish that I want to try again.
Hopefully next time it will be strong enough to really activate some endorphins.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>beef</category><category>garlic</category><category>ginger</category><category>pantry-raid</category><category>rice</category><category>Serious Eats</category><category>Sichuan</category><category>spicy</category><category>tofu</category><guid>https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/mapo-tofu/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 30 May 2022 13:30:38 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Korean Cheese Corn</title><link>https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/korean-cheese-corn/</link><dc:creator>Matt Anderson</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;I had a lot of leftover frozen corn, so I made &lt;a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/korean-corn-cheese-5196495"&gt;Korean Cheese Corn&lt;/a&gt;.
I didn't have doenjang, so I replaced it with white miso and a little gochujang.
It's decent, but I didn't like it as the main course.
