I didn't have doenjang, so I replaced it with white miso and a little gochujang.
It's decent, but I didn't like it as the main course. 
It would probably be much better with lots of beer and other appetizers like the article says.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>appetizer</category><category>bar</category><category>cheese</category><category>corn</category><category>gochujang</category><category>korean</category><category>meh</category><category>miso</category><category>pantry-raid</category><category>seriouseats</category><guid>https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/korean-cheese-corn/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 24 May 2022 00:44:12 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Chicory Chocolate Banana Cake</title><link>https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/chicory-chocolate-banana-cake/</link><dc:creator>Matt Anderson</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;I bought some chicory root online to explore some new tea blends and coffee alternative.
However, I bought far too much for just some experiments.
As usual, I searched around for some recipes to use more of it.
I decided to make &lt;a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/new-orleans-snack-cake"&gt;chicory chocolate banana cake&lt;/a&gt;.
It's definitely a bit odd, but turned out very good after sitting for a couple days.
I'd describe it as a coffee banana brownie.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>banana</category><category>cake</category><category>chicory</category><category>chocolate</category><category>coffee</category><category>pantry-raid</category><category>seriouseats</category><guid>https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/chicory-chocolate-banana-cake/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 24 May 2022 00:43:53 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Squash and Miso Soup From the Pantry</title><link>https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/squash-and-miso-soup-from-the-pantry/</link><dc:creator>Matt Anderson</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;I wanted to make &lt;a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/miso-squash-soup-recipe"&gt;Miso-Squash Soup With Sesame-Ginger Apples&lt;/a&gt;, but I couldn't find all the ingredients.
In particular, I couldn't find bonito flakes at the normal place.
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katsuobushi"&gt;Bonito flakes (katsuobushi)&lt;/a&gt; are simmered, smoked and fermented skipjack tuna.
They give dashi (kombu + katsuobushi), a japanese fish stock which is the base of miso soup, a smoky/meaty flavor.
I couldn't even find it (or instant dashi for that matter!) in the biggest Asian market in my city.
So, I had to improvise a bit.
A while ago, I was really into making different kinds of stocks.
I had frozen quarts of a &lt;a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/hearty-vegetable-stock-vegan-recipe"&gt;vegan stock&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/fish-stock-fumet-recipe"&gt;French fish stock (fumet)&lt;/a&gt;.
I decided to replace the dashi with a combination of these two stocks because the vegan stock included kombu and dried mushrooms while the fumet was the only fishy stock I had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I boosted the fish flavor with some anchovy paste that I normally use in Italian dishes.
I also used two acorn squash instead of the butternut asked for in the recipe.
I like acorn squash because you can eat the thinner skin once cooked and they work very well in braised dishes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really like this dish because it reminds me of fall with the squash and apples, but still has a distinct flavor from the Asian ingredients.
Emptying my older pantry items is a big plus as well.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>acorn</category><category>apple</category><category>bonito</category><category>dashi</category><category>fish</category><category>fumet</category><category>katsuobushi</category><category>miso</category><category>pantry</category><category>pantry-raid</category><category>seriouseats</category><category>soup</category><category>squash</category><category>stock</category><guid>https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/squash-and-miso-soup-from-the-pantry/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 06 May 2022 18:05:07 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Carrot Cake Jam and Cheesecake</title><link>https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/carrot-cake-jam-and-cheesecake/</link><dc:creator>Matt Anderson</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;I visited my family recently for Easter.
We cook a big meal with a ham and multiple soup options.
My sister and I requested extra vegetables for crudités.
We ended up getting too much and I brought home &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; of carrots.
I was searching for a carrot cake recipe and stumbled across a &lt;a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/carrot-cake-conserve-recipe"&gt;carrot cake conserve recipe&lt;/a&gt;.
I decided to make it because it was weird and I still had some commercial pectin that I was too scared to use in my &lt;a href="https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/sous-vide-raspberry-hibiscus-cheesecake/"&gt;raspberry hibiscus jam&lt;/a&gt;.
I had reservations on using pineapple, but it turned out really well.
It doesn't taste too much of any of the fruit included and truly does taste like carrot cake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I combined this jam with my favorite &lt;a href="https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/sous-vide-raspberry-hibiscus-cheesecake/"&gt;sous vide cheesecake recipe&lt;/a&gt; to make carrot cheesecake.
Instead of using graham crackers, I just sprinkled chopped walnuts on top.
I like the cheesecake a lot, but my favorite way to eat the jam is on a bagel with cream cheese and walnuts.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>cake</category><category>carrot</category><category>cheesecake</category><category>goodeats</category><category>jam</category><category>pantry-raid</category><category>pectin</category><category>preserves</category><category>raisin</category><category>seriouseats</category><category>sous-vide</category><category>walnut</category><guid>https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/carrot-cake-jam-and-cheesecake/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 01 May 2022 18:03:54 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Schmaltz, Garlic Confit, and Matzo Ball Soup</title><link>https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/schmaltz-garlic-confit-and-matzo-ball-soup/</link><dc:creator>Matt Anderson</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;As previously mentioned, I like to buy whole chickens, break them down my self, and use the carcasses to make homemade stock.
However, this means I also have a &lt;em&gt;ton&lt;/em&gt; of chicken skin saved up as well.
I had 3 quart bags filled with skin and decided something needed to be done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the only thing I can really think to do with lots of chicken skin is to render out the fat, otherwise known as schmaltz.
Making schmaltz is pretty easy, just combine the skin with some water to start the rendering process and continue to cook until the fat is all rendered out.
I chopped the skin into smaller pieces to aid the rendering and was the most time consuming part.
Optionally, you can add some diced onion near the end to add some flavor. 
I ended up getting 1.5 pints of schmaltz from all that skin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing I made was confit garlic.
I packed a bunch of garlic cloves in a mason jar with the schmaltz and cooked it with an immersion circulator (sous vide) at 190F until lightly golden brown (about 6 hours).
The garlic cloves turn jammy and can be used as a savory spread.
I took it to a family gathering and added it to mashed potatos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next thing I made was &lt;a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/the-best-matzo-balls-recipe"&gt;Matzo Ball Soup&lt;/a&gt; with some homemade stock and off the shelf matzo meal.
The schmaltz is added to the matzo balls for tenderness and flavor.
It reminded me of a chicken noodle soup with dumplings instead of noodles.
I also added extra dill because it's one of my favorite herbs.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>carrot</category><category>chicken</category><category>confit</category><category>dill</category><category>fat</category><category>garlic</category><category>matzo</category><category>pantry-raid</category><category>schmaltz</category><category>seriouseats</category><category>soup</category><guid>https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/schmaltz-garlic-confit-and-matzo-ball-soup/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 26 Apr 2022 02:12:48 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Chili Crisp Factory</title><link>https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/chili-crisp-factory/</link><dc:creator>Matt Anderson</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;This weekend I got a bunch of friends together to make chili crisp with me because they all love it and I'm tired of doing it all in my own.
It presented a couple challenges though.
First, I decided to make a double recipe and split it three ways.
There are lot's of respiratory irritants (chili powder and sliced shallots) in this recipe so there was constant coughing, sneezing, and crying (In retrospect, not the best idea to do with friends).
We were also cooking at my friend's house rather than my kitchen.
This was only a minor challenge in that I was in charge but unfamiliar with the equipment which led to some last second scrambling.
And lastly, we started at 8PM which was a big mistake. We didn't finish until 11:30PM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was still a lot of fun and we all got something to show for it.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>chili</category><category>crisp</category><category>factory</category><category>friends</category><category>seriouseats</category><category>spicy</category><guid>https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/chili-crisp-factory/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 11 Apr 2022 00:45:08 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Buttermilk Brined Fried Chicken and Biscuits</title><link>https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/buttermilk-brined-fried-chicken-and-biscuits/</link><dc:creator>Matt Anderson</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;My roommate recently watched J. Kenji Lopez-Alt's &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5nKYqvu29w"&gt;video on buttermilk brined fried ckicken&lt;/a&gt; which is &lt;a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/the-food-lab-southern-fried-chicken-recipe"&gt;adapted from his book&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/n5nKYqvu29w" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He offered to cook everything if I broke down the whole chicken. 
I really enjoy breaking down whole chickens so that I can save the carcass for stock.
I even asked for a nice boning knife one Christmas solely for processing whole chicken and fish.
There is one oddity in this recipe in which you leave the plate attached, but cut the breast in half the short way resulting in 4 square-ish pieces. 
In my case, the tenderloin separated from the breast and the plate which made it very awkward to fry. 
We ended up with a couple tenderloin nuggets because of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also made &lt;a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/light-and-fluffy-biscuit-recipe"&gt;yogurt biscuits&lt;/a&gt; with the leftover buttermilk.
Ironically, this recipe was originally developed to replace buttermilk with yogurt.
My biscuits came out a bit dense. I imagine that the pH balance was off due to the buttermilk which affected the rise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chicken was pretty good, but we found that the second fry didn't add much more value for the extra time and effort.
It's only worth it if you are obsessed with crispiness.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>biscuits</category><category>buttermilk</category><category>chicken</category><category>fried</category><category>seriouseats</category><category>youtube</category><guid>https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/buttermilk-brined-fried-chicken-and-biscuits/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 03 Apr 2022 19:38:26 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Spicy Chili Crisp Gifts</title><link>https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/spicy-chili-crisp-gifts/</link><dc:creator>Matt Anderson</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;I'm visiting my family this weekend. 
I made a couple gifts for some of them and I felt like I needed to make enough for all of them.
I've also been obsessed with the &lt;a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/homemade-spicy-chili-crisp"&gt;chili crisp recipe&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GezQyVRQRzU"&gt;Sohla El-Waylly&lt;/a&gt; during her time at Serious Eats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GezQyVRQRzU" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's a wonderful combination of fried shallots and garlic for crunch, dried chilis for heat, and Asian spices (most notably Szechuan peppercorns) for aroma.
I've been trading it with my friends for some of their food products, such as ground deer meat and homemade &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DUkE6cgUg"&gt;Dongo&lt;/a&gt;.
So, I thought sharing my obsession would be the perfect gift for the rest of my family. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I didn't start the process until 8PM which was a poor decision. 
I finished cooking and cleaning around midnight.
I would highly recommend getting others to help make this recipe.
In fact, make it a party, make a big batch, and send everyone home with their own.
Deseeding the chilis takes the most time.
The Arbol chilis in particular are the most annoying due to their small size and large quantity.
Frying the shallots also takes some time and practice.
It requires constant stirring and attention because they soggy to crisp in less than a minute. 
I like to stir with chopsticks as the shallots don't attach to them very much.
The rest of the process is pretty straightforward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been actively searching for something that this &lt;em&gt;doesn't&lt;/em&gt; work well with and so far, I've come up empty.
Here is a categorization of things I've tried the chili crisp with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Great&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By the spoonful&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pizza&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eggs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avocado toast&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pasta sauce (a la aglio e olio)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chicken salad wraps/sandwiches&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cookies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Caramel Girl Scout cookies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oatmeal Creampie&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vanilla ice cream&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Okay&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Coffee&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Bad&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nothing yet!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll keep updating this list as I try new things.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>chili</category><category>crisp</category><category>gift</category><category>seriouseats</category><category>spicy</category><category>youtube</category><guid>https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/spicy-chili-crisp-gifts/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 19 Mar 2022 14:37:39 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Halal Cart-Style Chicken and Tzatziki</title><link>https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/halal-cart-style-chicken-and-tzatziki/</link><dc:creator>Matt Anderson</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;My roommate has a favorite &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOkL5d8t1sM"&gt;tzatziki recipe&lt;/a&gt; he likes to make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/OOkL5d8t1sM" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When he told me he was going to make that and nothing else, I decided to help him round out the meal. 
I made the chicken and rice from Serious Eats' &lt;a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/serious-eats-halal-cart-style-chicken-and-rice-white-sauce-recipe"&gt;Halal Cart-Style Chicken and Rice with White Sauce&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href="https://www.themediterraneandish.com/tabouli-salad/"&gt;Tabouli salad&lt;/a&gt;.
I made the rice with some homemade chicken stock as well.
May favorite part of the meal is the chicken. 
The marinade is really excellent!&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>chicken</category><category>condiment</category><category>mediterranean</category><category>rice</category><category>salad</category><category>seriouseats</category><category>tabouli</category><category>themediterraneandish</category><category>tzatziki</category><category>youtube</category><guid>https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/halal-cart-style-chicken-and-tzatziki/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 09 Mar 2022 18:17:18 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Impromptu BBQ Potluck</title><link>https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/impromptu-bbq-potluck/</link><dc:creator>Matt Anderson</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;My friend with a smoker decided to randomly make some pulled pork this weekend. 
We decided to have an impromptu potluck.
I signed up to make the side dishes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My friend and I had previously lamented the over-doneness of mac and cheese at typical BBQ restaurants.
So, I made some &lt;a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/classic-bechamel-baked-mac-cheese-recipe"&gt;classic baked mac and cheese&lt;/a&gt;. 
It is just parcooked pasta in a mornay sauce with breadcrumbs on top that is baked like a casserole. 
I used cellentani instead of elbow macaroni because I like the shape better.
I also added a pinch of truffle powder to the sauce for extra flavor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I typically don't like creamy American coleslaw because of its cloying sweetness.
However, I really wanted to top the pulled pork sandwiches with something. 
I made &lt;a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/the-food-lab-how-to-make-the-best-creamy-cole-slaw"&gt;creamy coleslaw&lt;/a&gt; by J. Kenji Lopez-Alt.
Even though it makes a giant mess, I really like this recipe.
I think the keys to success are "curing" the vegetables, and using the best quality mayonnaise.
The best quality mayo will always be homemade.
J. Kenji also has a great (fast) &lt;a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/two-minute-mayonnaise"&gt;mayo recipe&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I wanted an alternative to the coleslaw, so I made &lt;a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/quick-dill-pickle-chips-recipe"&gt;quick pickles&lt;/a&gt;. 
They taste strongly of dill, garlic, and vinegar which is my favorite kind of pickle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, it was a great success!&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>Americana</category><category>barbeque</category><category>BBQ</category><category>friends</category><category>potluck</category><category>seriouseats</category><category>side-dish</category><guid>https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/impromptu-bbq-potluck/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 06 Mar 2022 18:58:05 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
