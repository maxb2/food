This time I was looking for old-fashioned oatmeal recipes, but it led me to another unused ingredient, pureed pumpkin.
I originally bought it when I was experimenting with a low-carb diet and didn't really like it in less sweet applications. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Serendipitously, a &lt;a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/pumpkin-skillet-coffeecake-with-streusel-topping"&gt;pumpkin skillet coffee cake with oatmeal streusel&lt;/a&gt; could use both of these ingredients.
I really liked this cake, especially the texture that the white chocolate adds.
I didn't have any pecans, so I replaced them with some walnuts and pepitas (green pumpkin seeds).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, this only used a fraction of each ingredient.
It didn't even use the whole can of pureed pumpkin that I opened.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>cake</category><category>coffee</category><category>pantry raid</category><category>pumpkin</category><category>Serious Eats</category><category>skillet</category><guid>https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/pumpkin-skillet-coffee-cake/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 09 Jul 2022 14:51:30 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
