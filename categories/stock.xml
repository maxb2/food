This recipe for &lt;a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/hearty-vegetable-stock-vegan-recipe"&gt;Vegan Stock&lt;/a&gt; is a great base on which to build more dishes.
The secret to making a vegetable stock taste richer, is to use natural sources of glutamates (rich, meaty flavors).
Both dried mushrooms and kombu (dried kelp) are an excellent source of glutamates that are natural fits for stock.
As I'm making other dishes, I will save certain scraps in the freezer for stock.
For this stock, I saved up some mushroom, celery, and leek scraps.
Throw everything together and boil for a short while (bones in normal stock takes forever to extract).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vegan stock tastes very rich and yet still aromatic due to it only being vegetables.
The only thing that it lacks is the mouth feel you get from gelatin.
However, it's a small price to pay for sticking to your morals, especially when the flavor is so good.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>mushroom</category><category>pantry raid</category><category>Serious Eats</category><category>stock</category><category>vegan</category><category>vegetable</category><guid>https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/vegetable-stock/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 06 Aug 2022 21:04:53 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Squash and Miso Soup From the Pantry</title><link>https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/squash-and-miso-soup-from-the-pantry/</link><dc:creator>Matt Anderson</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;I wanted to make &lt;a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/miso-squash-soup-recipe"&gt;Miso-Squash Soup With Sesame-Ginger Apples&lt;/a&gt;, but I couldn't find all the ingredients.
In particular, I couldn't find bonito flakes at the normal place.
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katsuobushi"&gt;Bonito flakes (katsuobushi)&lt;/a&gt; are simmered, smoked and fermented skipjack tuna.
They give dashi (kombu + katsuobushi), a japanese fish stock which is the base of miso soup, a smoky/meaty flavor.
I couldn't even find it (or instant dashi for that matter!) in the biggest Asian market in my city.
So, I had to improvise a bit.
A while ago, I was really into making different kinds of stocks.
I had frozen quarts of a &lt;a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/hearty-vegetable-stock-vegan-recipe"&gt;vegan stock&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/fish-stock-fumet-recipe"&gt;French fish stock (fumet)&lt;/a&gt;.
I decided to replace the dashi with a combination of these two stocks because the vegan stock included kombu and dried mushrooms while the fumet was the only fishy stock I had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I boosted the fish flavor with some anchovy paste that I normally use in Italian dishes.
I also used two acorn squash instead of the butternut asked for in the recipe.
I like acorn squash because you can eat the thinner skin once cooked and they work very well in braised dishes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really like this dish because it reminds me of fall with the squash and apples, but still has a distinct flavor from the Asian ingredients.
Emptying my older pantry items is a big plus as well.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>acorn</category><category>apple</category><category>bonito</category><category>dashi</category><category>fish</category><category>fumet</category><category>katsuobushi</category><category>miso</category><category>pantry</category><category>pantry raid</category><category>Serious Eats</category><category>soup</category><category>squash</category><category>stock</category><guid>https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/squash-and-miso-soup-from-the-pantry/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 06 May 2022 18:05:07 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
