The second half of the day was a fun activity where we made our own cutting boards at a woodworking studio.
It was a lot of fun as my whole team is made of creative people. 
I also used to do a lot of woodworking when I was younger and it was nice to return to that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We made some standard edge grain cutting boards that you might see sold by an artist at a Farmer's market. 
The one thing that &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; surprised me was that during gluing the boards were only clamped for 30 minutes.
The leader of the class made the process really time efficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Afterward, a lady came and taught us how to make a charcuterie arangement on the boards we just made.
It was a fun time of drinking and making food art.
However, my salami rose looked more like a sombrero, so I decorated it as such.&lt;/p&gt;
