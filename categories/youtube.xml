&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/wSn8Yzz_QbA" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I vaguely remembered the egg salad from that video and decided to make my own.
In particular, I remembered that his wife made a deviled egg style filling that the chopped whites get tossed in.
I hardboiled 4 eggs by simmering them in just enough water to cover for 14 minutes.
I threw together a deviled egg filling loosely inspired by &lt;a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/great-deviled-eggs-recipe"&gt;J. Kenji's deviled egg recipe&lt;/a&gt;.
My favorite part of this recipe is the addition of a high quality olive oil.
A peppery oil works very well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time I combined egg yolks, &lt;a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/two-minute-mayonnaise"&gt;homemade mayo&lt;/a&gt;, stone-ground mustard, capers, diced celery and its leaves, diced dill pickle, salt, pepper, cayenne, and paprika to create the base.
Then I whisked in some olive oil until it became a lighter consistency and added the chopped egg whites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I served the egg salad in a wrap with a few leaves of red oakleaf lettuce from my countertop aerogarden.
If you like deviled eggs, this is a great excuse to make a meal out of them.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>Adam Ragusea</category><category>capers</category><category>celery</category><category>egg</category><category>homegrown</category><category>lettuce</category><category>mayo</category><category>pickle</category><category>salad</category><category>sandwiches</category><category>wraps</category><category>youtube</category><guid>https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/deviled-egg-salad/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 09 Jun 2022 13:43:25 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Stuffed Cabbage Rolls (Golubtsi)</title><link>https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/stuffed-cabbage-rolls-golubtsi/</link><dc:creator>Matt Anderson</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;I recently saw &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/helenrennie"&gt;Helen Rennie's&lt;/a&gt; video for stuffed cabbage rolls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/HmtK5er6GSc" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I love cabbage, I really wanted to try it.
I have a few pounds of ground deer meat that I got from a hunter friend, so I replaced the veal in the meatloaf mix with deer.
I also used the optional gelatin as a safegaurd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trimming the stems of the cabbage leaves was a great way to increase the flexibility of the leaves.
The filling was still a bit too crumbly at the end.
I could add more binders to the mix (breadcrumbs and eggs), and/or knead the mixture more to get it tighter.
My sauce also didn't reduce much during the braise, but that is not a problem when serving the rolls browned as suggested in the video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of steps in the process, but it felt very manageable with two people.
One of us focused on the cabbage and sauce while the other focused on the filling and forming of the rolls.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>beef</category><category>cabbage</category><category>carrot</category><category>deer</category><category>golubtsi</category><category>Helen Rennie</category><category>meatloaf</category><category>pantry-raid</category><category>rice</category><category>stuffed</category><category>tomato</category><category>youtube</category><guid>https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/stuffed-cabbage-rolls-golubtsi/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 29 May 2022 22:50:18 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Spinach and Feta Galette</title><link>https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/spinach-and-feta-galette/</link><dc:creator>Matt Anderson</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;I recently saw a video by a new-to-me food youtuber, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdTLhjAGVI_XDAuXrobtI6Q"&gt;Helen Rennie&lt;/a&gt;, for a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJn1jBlC2w8"&gt;Spinach and Feta Pie with Pizza Dough&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/YJn1jBlC2w8" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really liked the idea of making a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galette"&gt;galette&lt;/a&gt; (laziest/best way to make pie) with a no-knead pizza dough rather than a fiddly pie dough.
You mix up a pizza dough until it just comes together and then let it cold ferment 1-4 days in the fridge to develop gluten and flavor.
The process makes the dough extremely easy to shape later on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real star of the show was the filling.
Helen's suggestion to use all sorts of herbs really improves on the standard spinach pie formula.
Spinach and feta alone, while it provides a nice earthiness, is too one note for me.
So, the extra accents that the herbs provided are crucial.
I added parsley, green onions, and a dash of dried tarragon.
I couldn't get fresh dill on short notice, but I would have loved to add that as well.
I also coerced my roommate into making his favorite &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOkL5d8t1sM"&gt;tzatziki&lt;/a&gt; to contribute to the meal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/OOkL5d8t1sM" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did have a small issue with the technique presented in the video.
My tongs are not silicone tipped, so they ripped the parchment that had become brittle in the oven.
I wonder if a silicone mat might have worked better or if it would not have survived those temperatures directly on the oven rack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He offered to cook everything if I broke down the whole chicken. 
I really enjoy breaking down whole chickens so that I can save the carcass for stock.
I even asked for a nice boning knife one Christmas solely for processing whole chicken and fish.
There is one oddity in this recipe in which you leave the plate attached, but cut the breast in half the short way resulting in 4 square-ish pieces. 
In my case, the tenderloin separated from the breast and the plate which made it very awkward to fry. 
We ended up with a couple tenderloin nuggets because of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also made &lt;a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/light-and-fluffy-biscuit-recipe"&gt;yogurt biscuits&lt;/a&gt; with the leftover buttermilk.
Ironically, this recipe was originally developed to replace buttermilk with yogurt.
My biscuits came out a bit dense. I imagine that the pH balance was off due to the buttermilk which affected the rise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chicken was pretty good, but we found that the second fry didn't add much more value for the extra time and effort.
It's only worth it if you are obsessed with crispiness.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>biscuits</category><category>buttermilk</category><category>chicken</category><category>fried</category><category>Serious Eats</category><category>youtube</category><guid>https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/buttermilk-brined-fried-chicken-and-biscuits/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 03 Apr 2022 19:38:26 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Spicy Chili Crisp Gifts</title><link>https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/spicy-chili-crisp-gifts/</link><dc:creator>Matt Anderson</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;I'm visiting my family this weekend. 
I made a couple gifts for some of them and I felt like I needed to make enough for all of them.
I've also been obsessed with the &lt;a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/homemade-spicy-chili-crisp"&gt;chili crisp recipe&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GezQyVRQRzU"&gt;Sohla El-Waylly&lt;/a&gt; during her time at Serious Eats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GezQyVRQRzU" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's a wonderful combination of fried shallots and garlic for crunch, dried chilis for heat, and Asian spices (most notably Szechuan peppercorns) for aroma.
I've been trading it with my friends for some of their food products, such as ground deer meat and homemade &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DUkE6cgUg"&gt;Dongo&lt;/a&gt;.
So, I thought sharing my obsession would be the perfect gift for the rest of my family. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I didn't start the process until 8PM which was a poor decision. 
I finished cooking and cleaning around midnight.
I would highly recommend getting others to help make this recipe.
In fact, make it a party, make a big batch, and send everyone home with their own.
Deseeding the chilis takes the most time.
The Arbol chilis in particular are the most annoying due to their small size and large quantity.
Frying the shallots also takes some time and practice.
It requires constant stirring and attention because they soggy to crisp in less than a minute. 
I like to stir with chopsticks as the shallots don't attach to them very much.
The rest of the process is pretty straightforward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been actively searching for something that this &lt;em&gt;doesn't&lt;/em&gt; work well with and so far, I've come up empty.
Here is a categorization of things I've tried the chili crisp with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Great&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By the spoonful&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pizza&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eggs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avocado toast&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pasta sauce (a la aglio e olio)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chicken salad wraps/sandwiches&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cookies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Caramel Girl Scout cookies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oatmeal Creampie&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vanilla ice cream&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Okay&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Coffee&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Bad&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nothing yet!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll keep updating this list as I try new things.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>chili</category><category>crisp</category><category>gift</category><category>Serious Eats</category><category>Sichuan</category><category>spicy</category><category>youtube</category><guid>https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/spicy-chili-crisp-gifts/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 19 Mar 2022 14:37:39 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Halal Cart-Style Chicken and Tzatziki</title><link>https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/halal-cart-style-chicken-and-tzatziki/</link><dc:creator>Matt Anderson</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;My roommate has a favorite &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOkL5d8t1sM"&gt;tzatziki recipe&lt;/a&gt; he likes to make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/OOkL5d8t1sM" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When he told me he was going to make that and nothing else, I decided to help him round out the meal. 
I made the chicken and rice from Serious Eats' &lt;a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/serious-eats-halal-cart-style-chicken-and-rice-white-sauce-recipe"&gt;Halal Cart-Style Chicken and Rice with White Sauce&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href="https://www.themediterraneandish.com/tabouli-salad/"&gt;Tabouli salad&lt;/a&gt;.
I made the rice with some homemade chicken stock as well.
May favorite part of the meal is the chicken. 
The marinade is really excellent!&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>chicken</category><category>condiment</category><category>Food Wishes</category><category>Mediterranean</category><category>rice</category><category>salad</category><category>Serious Eats</category><category>tabouli</category><category>The Mediterranean Dish</category><category>tzatziki</category><category>youtube</category><guid>https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/halal-cart-style-chicken-and-tzatziki/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 09 Mar 2022 18:17:18 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Chicken Katsu Sandwiches</title><link>https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/chicken-katsu-sandwiches/</link><dc:creator>Matt Anderson</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;I still have a bunch of coleslaw from the &lt;a href="https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/impromptu-bbq-potluck/"&gt;Impromptu BBQ Potluck&lt;/a&gt; so my roommate suggested we make &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOsikxHW0JQ"&gt;spicy chicken katsu sandwiches&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/BOsikxHW0JQ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The original recipe uses lettuce and a spicy pickle mayo, but I think the coleslaw was even better.
We bought extra thighs for an upcoming meal which I deboned and deskinned. 
I'll save the bones for chicken stock and the skin for schmaltz.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>chicken</category><category>coleslaw</category><category>katsu</category><category>sandwich</category><category>spicy</category><category>youtube</category><guid>https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/chicken-katsu-sandwiches/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 08 Mar 2022 02:34:39 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
