    <p>My roommate recently watched J. Kenji Lopez-Alt's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5nKYqvu29w">video on buttermilk brined fried ckicken</a> which is <a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/the-food-lab-southern-fried-chicken-recipe">adapted from his book</a>.</p>

<p>He offered to cook everything if I broke down the whole chicken. 
I really enjoy breaking down whole chickens so that I can save the carcass for stock.
I even asked for a nice boning knife one Christmas solely for processing whole chicken and fish.
There is one oddity in this recipe in which you leave the plate attached, but cut the breast in half the short way resulting in 4 square-ish pieces. 
In my case, the tenderloin separated from the breast and the plate which made it very awkward to fry. 
We ended up with a couple tenderloin nuggets because of this.</p>
<p>I also made <a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/light-and-fluffy-biscuit-recipe">yogurt biscuits</a> with the leftover buttermilk.
Ironically, this recipe was originally developed to replace buttermilk with yogurt.
My biscuits came out a bit dense. I imagine that the pH balance was off due to the buttermilk which affected the rise.</p>
<p>The chicken was pretty good, but we found that the second fry didn't add much more value for the extra time and effort.
It's only worth it if you are obsessed with crispiness.</p>

    <p>I'm visiting my family this weekend. 
I made a couple gifts for some of them and I felt like I needed to make enough for all of them.
I've also been obsessed with the <a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/homemade-spicy-chili-crisp">chili crisp recipe</a> by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GezQyVRQRzU">Sohla El-Waylly</a> during her time at Serious Eats.</p>

<p>It's a wonderful combination of fried shallots and garlic for crunch, dried chilis for heat, and Asian spices (most notably Szechuan peppercorns) for aroma.
I've been trading it with my friends for some of their food products, such as ground deer meat and homemade <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3DUkE6cgUg">Dongo</a>.
So, I thought sharing my obsession would be the perfect gift for the rest of my family. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, I didn't start the process until 8PM which was a poor decision. 
I finished cooking and cleaning around midnight.
I would highly recommend getting others to help make this recipe.
In fact, make it a party, make a big batch, and send everyone home with their own.
Deseeding the chilis takes the most time.
The Arbol chilis in particular are the most annoying due to their small size and large quantity.
Frying the shallots also takes some time and practice.
It requires constant stirring and attention because they soggy to crisp in less than a minute. 
I like to stir with chopsticks as the shallots don't attach to them very much.
The rest of the process is pretty straightforward.</p>
<p>I've been actively searching for something that this <em>doesn't</em> work well with and so far, I've come up empty.
Here is a categorization of things I've tried the chili crisp with:</p>
<h4>Great</h4>
<ul>
<li>By the spoonful</li>
<li>Pizza</li>
<li>Eggs</li>
<li>Avocado toast</li>
<li>Pasta sauce (a la aglio e olio)</li>
<li>Chicken salad wraps/sandwiches</li>
<li>Cookies</li>
<li>Caramel Girl Scout cookies</li>
<li>Oatmeal Creampie</li>
<li>Vanilla ice cream</li>
</ul>
<h4>Okay</h4>
<ul>
<li>Coffee</li>
</ul>
<h4>Bad</h4>
<ul>
<li>Nothing yet!</li>
</ul>
<p>I'll keep updating this list as I try new things.</p>

    <p>My roommate has a favorite <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOkL5d8t1sM">tzatziki recipe</a> he likes to make.</p>

<p>When he told me he was going to make that and nothing else, I decided to help him round out the meal. 
I made the chicken and rice from Serious Eats' <a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/serious-eats-halal-cart-style-chicken-and-rice-white-sauce-recipe">Halal Cart-Style Chicken and Rice with White Sauce</a> and a <a href="https://www.themediterraneandish.com/tabouli-salad/">Tabouli salad</a>.
I made the rice with some homemade chicken stock as well.
May favorite part of the meal is the chicken. 
The marinade is really excellent!</p>

    <p>I still have a bunch of coleslaw from the <a href="posts/impromptu-bbq-potluck/">Impromptu BBQ Potluck</a> so my roommate suggested we make <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOsikxHW0JQ">spicy chicken katsu sandwiches</a>. </p>

<p>The original recipe uses lettuce and a spicy pickle mayo, but I think the coleslaw was even better.
We bought extra thighs for an upcoming meal which I deboned and deskinned. 
I'll save the bones for chicken stock and the skin for schmaltz.</p>

    <p>My friend with a smoker decided to randomly make some pulled pork this weekend. 
We decided to have an impromptu potluck.
I signed up to make the side dishes. </p>
<p>My friend and I had previously lamented the over-doneness of mac and cheese at typical BBQ restaurants.
So, I made some <a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/classic-bechamel-baked-mac-cheese-recipe">classic baked mac and cheese</a>. 
It is just parcooked pasta in a mornay sauce with breadcrumbs on top that is baked like a casserole. 
I used cellentani instead of elbow macaroni because I like the shape better.
I also added a pinch of truffle powder to the sauce for extra flavor.</p>
<p>I typically don't like creamy American coleslaw because of its cloying sweetness.
However, I really wanted to top the pulled pork sandwiches with something. 
I made <a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/the-food-lab-how-to-make-the-best-creamy-cole-slaw">creamy coleslaw</a> by J. Kenji Lopez-Alt.
Even though it makes a giant mess, I really like this recipe.
I think the keys to success are "curing" the vegetables, and using the best quality mayonnaise.
The best quality mayo will always be homemade.
J. Kenji also has a great (fast) <a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/two-minute-mayonnaise">mayo recipe</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, I wanted an alternative to the coleslaw, so I made <a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/quick-dill-pickle-chips-recipe">quick pickles</a>. 
They taste strongly of dill, garlic, and vinegar which is my favorite kind of pickle.</p>
<p>Overall, it was a great success!</p>
