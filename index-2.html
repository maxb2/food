    <p>I had a lot of leftover frozen corn, so I made <a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/korean-corn-cheese-5196495">Korean Cheese Corn</a>.
I didn't have doenjang, so I replaced it with white miso and a little gochujang.
It's decent, but I didn't like it as the main course. 
It would probably be much better with lots of beer and other appetizers like the article says.</p>

    <p>I bought some chicory root online to explore some new tea blends and coffee alternative.
However, I bought far too much for just some experiments.
As usual, I searched around for some recipes to use more of it.
I decided to make <a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/new-orleans-snack-cake">chicory chocolate banana cake</a>.
It's definitely a bit odd, but turned out very good after sitting for a couple days.
I'd describe it as a coffee banana brownie.</p>

    <p>I recently saw a video by a new-to-me food youtuber, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdTLhjAGVI_XDAuXrobtI6Q">Helen Rennie</a>, for a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJn1jBlC2w8">Spinach and Feta Pie with Pizza Dough</a>.</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/YJn1jBlC2w8" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>I really liked the idea of making a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galette">galette</a> (laziest/best way to make pie) with a no-knead pizza dough rather than a fiddly pie dough.
You mix up a pizza dough until it just comes together and then let it cold ferment 1-4 days in the fridge to develop gluten and flavor.
The process makes the dough extremely easy to shape later on.</p>
<p>The real star of the show was the filling.
Helen's suggestion to use all sorts of herbs really improves on the standard spinach pie formula.
Spinach and feta alone, while it provides a nice earthiness, is too one note for me.
So, the extra accents that the herbs provided are crucial.
I added parsley, green onions, and a dash of dried tarragon.
I couldn't get fresh dill on short notice, but I would have loved to add that as well.
I also coerced my roommate into making his favorite <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOkL5d8t1sM">tzatziki</a> to contribute to the meal.</p>

<p>I did have a small issue with the technique presented in the video.
My tongs are not silicone tipped, so they ripped the parchment that had become brittle in the oven.
I wonder if a silicone mat might have worked better or if it would not have survived those temperatures directly on the oven rack.</p>

    <p>I wanted to make <a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/miso-squash-soup-recipe">Miso-Squash Soup With Sesame-Ginger Apples</a>, but I couldn't find all the ingredients.
In particular, I couldn't find bonito flakes at the normal place.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katsuobushi">Bonito flakes (katsuobushi)</a> are simmered, smoked and fermented skipjack tuna.
They give dashi (kombu + katsuobushi), a japanese fish stock which is the base of miso soup, a smoky/meaty flavor.
I couldn't even find it (or instant dashi for that matter!) in the biggest Asian market in my city.
So, I had to improvise a bit.
A while ago, I was really into making different kinds of stocks.
I had frozen quarts of a <a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/hearty-vegetable-stock-vegan-recipe">vegan stock</a> and a <a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/fish-stock-fumet-recipe">French fish stock (fumet)</a>.
I decided to replace the dashi with a combination of these two stocks because the vegan stock included kombu and dried mushrooms while the fumet was the only fishy stock I had.</p>
<p>I boosted the fish flavor with some anchovy paste that I normally use in Italian dishes.
I also used two acorn squash instead of the butternut asked for in the recipe.
I like acorn squash because you can eat the thinner skin once cooked and they work very well in braised dishes.</p>
<p>I really like this dish because it reminds me of fall with the squash and apples, but still has a distinct flavor from the Asian ingredients.
Emptying my older pantry items is a big plus as well.</p>

    <p>I visited my family recently for Easter.
We cook a big meal with a ham and multiple soup options.
My sister and I requested extra vegetables for crudités.
We ended up getting too much and I brought home <em>a lot</em> of carrots.
I was searching for a carrot cake recipe and stumbled across a <a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/carrot-cake-conserve-recipe">carrot cake conserve recipe</a>.
I decided to make it because it was weird and I still had some commercial pectin that I was too scared to use in my <a href="posts/sous-vide-raspberry-hibiscus-cheesecake/">raspberry hibiscus jam</a>.
I had reservations on using pineapple, but it turned out really well.
It doesn't taste too much of any of the fruit included and truly does taste like carrot cake.</p>
<p>I combined this jam with my favorite <a href="posts/sous-vide-raspberry-hibiscus-cheesecake/">sous vide cheesecake recipe</a> to make carrot cheesecake.
Instead of using graham crackers, I just sprinkled chopped walnuts on top.
I like the cheesecake a lot, but my favorite way to eat the jam is on a bagel with cream cheese and walnuts.</p>
