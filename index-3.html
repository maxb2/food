    <p>On occasion I will scour the internet for recipes to use up an indegredient I have too much of (see the <a href="categories/pantry-raid/"> pantry raid</a> tag).
This time I was looking for old-fashioned oatmeal recipes, but it led me to another unused ingredient, pureed pumpkin.
I originally bought it when I was experimenting with a low-carb diet and didn't really like it in less sweet applications. </p>
<p>Serendipitously, a <a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/pumpkin-skillet-coffeecake-with-streusel-topping">pumpkin skillet coffee cake with oatmeal streusel</a> could use both of these ingredients.
I really liked this cake, especially the texture that the white chocolate adds.
I didn't have any pecans, so I replaced them with some walnuts and pepitas (green pumpkin seeds).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this only used a fraction of each ingredient.
It didn't even use the whole can of pureed pumpkin that I opened.</p>

    <p>The Independence Day gathering that I brought the <a href="posts/practical-baked-alaska/">Baked Alaska</a> to was a potluck.
The host made a really good watermelon, spinach, parmesan, and Balsamic vinagrette salad.
The watermelon they bought was <em>huge</em>, so they sent me home with half of it.
I found a <a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/watermelon-gazpacho-with-calabrian-chili-crema">watermelon gazpacho recipe</a> to try to use it all up.</p>
<p>I couldn't find Calabrian chilis, so I just used some serranos.
I also found that it needed much more vinegar than the recipe called for.
Actually, it was quite hard to season the fresh soup, probably because it was cold and the flavors needed to mingle.
It turned out really well after resting in the fridge though.
This made me really appreciate the spicy watermelon combo.</p>
<p>I still have way too much frozen watermelon leftover though...</p>

    <p>Baked Alaska has been a running joke with my culinary friends for a few years.
We would make the most annoying menus possible for hypothetical events.
It would include Baked Alaska, Beef Wellington, truffle anything, etc.</p>
<p>So, when I saw a video for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEUSxRNlodc">practical Baked Alaska</a> I knew I had to try it.
It also helped that my friends were having a small Independence Day gathering and that I'm looking for stand mixer projects to use my new toy.</p>

<p>The practical approach is to make each component separately and assemble in one pan.
The chocolate cake is dense, almost a brownie, and has a large fat ration to keep it from freezing rock hard.
The best approach for the ice cream is to just buy it and let it soften a little before spreading on the chilled cake.
My favorite part of this recipe is that while the egg yolks and whites are separated, they are all used.
I really hate having egg parts hanging around in the fridge that I can't find a use for.
The Italian Meringue was straight forward, but it was my first time making any meringue.
I'm just grateful that I didn't splatter the lava hot syrup on myself.</p>
<p>So, you just layer everything in the cake pan and freeze until serving.
Before serving, you are supposed to scorch the meringue to add a toasted marshmallow flavor.
I went to a hardware store to buy a cheap butane torch.
It turned out to be a normal cigarette lighter with a fancy nozzle.
It had issues staying lit, so I broiled the whole dish for <em>literally</em> seconds and refroze it for a bit.</p>
<p>It was a really good dessert, impressive looking too, but it ruined the party by making everyone tired.
Because of the extra time it took to make each component, I'd probably only make this again for special occassions.</p>

    <p>When I was researching the <a href="posts/schmaltz-garlic-confit-and-matzo-ball-soup/">matzo ball soup</a>, I came across something amusing: <a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/how-to-make-masa-ball-soup-mexican-jewish-matzo-corn">Masa ball soup</a>.
It's a Mexican take on the original dish. 
Both are essentially dumplings in chicken soup.
The dumplings here are made of masa, a specially treated corn flour used in tortillas, tamales, etc.
The last minor differences are using squash and cilantro instead of carrots and dill.
It's those changes that give the dish a Mexican flavor.</p>
<p>The masa ball dough was pretty loose which made me fear that the balls would disintegrate while cooking.
Fortunately, they stayed together despite being a bit deformed.
Overall, this was the best tasting pun I've eaten, but I prefer the original a little more.</p>
<p>While I had the masa flour out, I decided to try making <a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/champurrado-mexican-hot-chocolate-corn-drink-recipe">champurrado</a>, a thickened hot chocolate drink.
I felt like the recipe was a bit lacking, so I added some cayenne, cumin, and coriander.
It was pretty good, but not the right time of year for hot chocolate.
One plus is that it sets up as a pudding when cooled which fit the season better.</p>
