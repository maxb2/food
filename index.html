    <p>I saw a video for simple <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azNHrhGoOrc">sheet pan pasta dishes</a>.</p>

<p>I had made something similar to the tomato based one years ago (the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3gvRjIQ6Lo">viral baked feta pasta thing</a>).
So, I decided to try the more unusual fennel, radicchio, and white bean recipe.
However, I couldn't find radicchio and the fennel I did find was pretty anemic.
He described radicchio (I've never had it) as a bitter cross between lettuce and cabbage.
Bok choy sounded like a close enough alternative since it has a hard cabbage side and a leafy lettuce side.</p>
<p>I broiled everything like in the video.
I especially liked the light charring on the bok choy leaves.
I did find that it needed <em>both</em> cheese and lemon (he said one or the other).</p>
<p>I thought this dish was alright, but nothing to write home about.
That's a weird phrase since I am literally writing about it...
Anyway, I like the method and will try again with other combinations.</p>

    <p>I bought a pound of loose leaf Thai tea a while back because I really love Thai iced tea in restaurants.
For a while, I was making it all the time at home with various milks.
The drink is really good, but I wanted to find something else to try.
I found a <a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/thai-tea-cake-with-condensed-milk-custard-sauce-recipe">Thai tea cake with custard recipe</a>.
The cake is pretty straightforward, even though I had to buy a new pan.
You just steep the tea in some warm milk before incorporating into the cake.</p>
<p>For the custard, I couldn't find sweetened condensed milk, only sweetened condensed <em>coconut</em> milk.
I felt that was perhaps a more fitting alternative anyway.
The custard was pretty standard as well.
However, it uses 6 egg yolks, so I didn't actually reduce my unused pantry ingredients with all the extra egg whites sitting around.</p>
<p>This is a really great desert.
The cake becomes a nice orange color and the coconut custard awesome.
I only wish that the tea flavor were stronger.
You have to eat the cake without any custard to get any hint of tea.</p>

    <p>In my last post, I made a <a href="posts/pumpkin-skillet-coffee-cake/">pumpkin coffee cake</a> that left me with a decent amount of opened pumpkin puree.
So, in an attempt to use it before it goes bad, I made <a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/pumpkin-sweet-swirl-buns">pumpkin sweet swirl buns</a> (similar to cinnamon buns).
I didn't have graham crackers, so I ground up a crunchy granola bar that aready had pimpkin seeds in it.
I also had to grind hazelnuts into a meal which is a bit tricky not to turn into nut butter.</p>
<p>This used almost all of the remaining puree which is great. 
It also let me use my stand mixer to knead the dough.
I'm glad for any chance to use it.</p>
<p>At first, I was afraid I didn't roll the dough tight enough to get a good swirl.
However, the overnight proof in the fridge filled in the gaps.
I also made a cream cheese frosting by whipping cream cheese, lemon juice, vanilla extract, and powdered sugar together.
You can add a little bit of water to thin it out to your desired consistency.</p>
<p>The buns were really good!
They were perfectly fluffy, a nice shade of orange, and the hazelnut filling was a perfect match for the spices.
My only (minor) complaint is that the pumpkin flavor was not strong enough.
I think the best takeaway is to try other fillings for cinnamon rolls.
The dough is just a fluffy, yeasty, buttery vehicle for the filling.</p>

    <p>On occasion I will scour the internet for recipes to use up an indegredient I have too much of (see the <a href="categories/pantry-raid/">pantry-raid</a> tag).
This time I was looking for old-fashioned oatmeal recipes, but it led me to another unused ingredient, pureed pumpkin.
I originally bought it when I was experimenting with a low-carb diet and didn't really like it in less sweet applications. </p>
<p>Serendipitously, a <a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/pumpkin-skillet-coffeecake-with-streusel-topping">pumpkin skillet coffee cake with oatmeal streusel</a> could use both of these ingredients.
I really liked this cake, especially the texture that the white chocolate adds.
I didn't have any pecans, so I replaced them with some walnuts and pepitas (green pumpkin seeds).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this only used a fraction of each ingredient.
It didn't even use the whole can of pureed pumpkin that I opened.</p>

    <p>The Independence Day gathering that I brought the <a href="posts/practical-baked-alaska/">Baked Alaska</a> to was a potluck.
The host made a really good watermelon, spinach, parmesan, and Balsamic vinagrette salad.
The watermelon they bought was <em>huge</em>, so they sent me home with half of it.
I found a <a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/watermelon-gazpacho-with-calabrian-chili-crema">watermelon gazpacho recipe</a> to try to use it all up.</p>
<p>I couldn't find Calabrian chilis, so I just used some serranos.
I also found that it needed much more vinegar than the recipe called for.
Actually, it was quite hard to season the fresh soup, probably because it was cold and the flavors needed to mingle.
It turned out really well after resting in the fridge though.
This made me really appreciate the spicy watermelon combo.</p>
<p>I still have way too much frozen watermelon leftover though...</p>

    <p>Baked Alaska has been a running joke with my culinary friends for a few years.
We would make the most annoying menus possible for hypothetical events.
It would include Baked Alaska, Beef Wellington, truffle anything, etc.</p>
<p>So, when I saw a video for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEUSxRNlodc">practical Baked Alaska</a> I knew I had to try it.
It also helped that my friends were having a small Independence Day gathering and that I'm looking for stand mixer projects to use my new toy.</p>

<p>The practical approach is to make each component separately and assemble in one pan.
The chocolate cake is dense, almost a brownie, and has a large fat ration to keep it from freezing rock hard.
The best approach for the ice cream is to just buy it and let it soften a little before spreading on the chilled cake.
My favorite part of this recipe is that while the egg yolks and whites are separated, they are all used.
I really hate having egg parts hanging around in the fridge that I can't find a use for.
The Italian Meringue was straight forward, but it was my first time making any meringue.
I'm just grateful that I didn't splatter the lava hot syrup on myself.</p>
<p>So, you just layer everything in the cake pan and freeze until serving.
Before serving, you are supposed to scorch the meringue to add a toasted marshmallow flavor.
I went to a hardware store to buy a cheap butane torch.
It turned out to be a normal cigarette lighter with a fancy nozzle.
It had issues staying lit, so I broiled the whole dish for <em>literally</em> seconds and refroze it for a bit.</p>
<p>It was a really good dessert, impressive looking too, but it ruined the party by making everyone tired.
Because of the extra time it took to make each component, I'd probably only make this again for special occassions.</p>

    <p>When I was researching the <a href="posts/schmaltz-garlic-confit-and-matzo-ball-soup/">matzo ball soup</a>, I came across something amusing: <a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/how-to-make-masa-ball-soup-mexican-jewish-matzo-corn">Masa ball soup</a>.
It's a Mexican take on the original dish. 
Both are essentially dumplings in chicken soup.
The dumplings here are made of masa, a specially treated corn flour used in tortillas, tamales, etc.
The last minor differences are using squash and cilantro instead of carrots and dill.
It's those changes that give the dish a Mexican flavor.</p>
<p>The masa ball dough was pretty loose which made me fear that the balls would disintegrate while cooking.
Fortunately, they stayed together despite being a bit deformed.
Overall, this was the best tasting pun I've eaten, but I prefer the original a little more.</p>
<p>While I had the masa flour out, I decided to try making <a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/champurrado-mexican-hot-chocolate-corn-drink-recipe">champurrado</a>, a thickened hot chocolate drink.
I felt like the recipe was a bit lacking, so I added some cayenne, cumin, and coriander.
It was pretty good, but not the right time of year for hot chocolate.
One plus is that it sets up as a pudding when cooled which fit the season better.</p>

    <p>My roommate's girlfriend makes a lot of chocolate desserts that he brings home to share with me.
She made some really good brownies which inspired me to return the favor.
However, I wanted to make it a little weirder, so I used Serious Eats' <a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/ginger-spice-brownies-5216863">ginger spice brownies recipe</a>.
This is a heavily spiced dessert akin to gingerbread.
The brownies are great with a complex flavor, but they ended up being cakier than I prefer.
The recipe calls for the cake to register at 210°F, which  may be the culprit, or perhaps too much flour.</p>
<p>Since it includes such intense flavors, I thought it would be nice to pair it with something fatty to balance it.
I took the opportunity to try Adam Ragusea's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-SikBqk2PM">2 Bowl Ice Cream</a> method.</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/p-SikBqk2PM" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>I had a few problems with this method.
While I did incorporate a significant amount of air, I never got to stiff peaks while whipping the ice cream base.
I think that may be because I added too much milk, throwing off the fat to water ratio.
The base didn't deflate much on the second mixing either.
I also accidentally added peppermint extract instead of vanilla, so I had to pivot to a mint chocolate chip ice cream.
Luckily, the ginger spice brownies still go well with mint.
I ended up with 2 and a half quarts which was way more than I expected (probably due to the retained air).</p>

    </header><div class="e-content entry-content">
    <p>In 2017 I visited New Orleans for a work conference.
On my last day there, I had crawfish étouffée for the first time.
It was so good that it made a lasting impression on me.
Last year, I tried the crawfish étouffée from a new-ish Cajun restaurant where I live.
Unfortunately, I was not impressed.
To be fair, it was not bad, I was just comparing it to a rose-tinted memory of a dish made by the actual authorities on the dish.
Nonetheless, the experience inspired me to make étouffée myself.</p>
<p>I used the Serious Eats recipe for <a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/shrimp-etouffee">shrimp étouffée</a> since it's a bit difficult to get crawfish where I live.
It consists of two major operations: making a shrimp stock and making the étouffée itself.
The base of the stock is made from the shells of the shrimp used later in the main dish.
It is a relatively quick stock since you are only extracting flavor and not gelatin like a bone-based stock or broth.
However, it still helps to split the two operations up in time.
The recipe also makes enough stock for two batches of étouffée.
So, I froze one quart for a future use.</p>
<p>All of which brings us to the present day where I was searching for something to make and remembered the special purpose shrimp stock that had been in my freezer for a year. 
Making the étouffée itself is pretty simple, it's just make a roux, sweat some <a href="https://www.thespruceeats.com/cajun-trinity-of-cooking-3052290">Cajun trinity vegetables</a>, add spices and the stock, simmer until vegetables are soft, and cook your meat in the sauce.
In my opinion, the most impactful step is making the roux.
I like a "peanut butter" colored roux because it adds a complex, nutty flavor without overshadowing the other flavors.
This time, I also added some home grown garlic scapes as a garnish.
Finally, serve with rice and a dry white wine.</p>

    <p>I little while ago I saw a video about various sandwich "salads" by Adam Ragusea.</p>

<p>I vaguely remembered the egg salad from that video and decided to make my own.
In particular, I remembered that his wife made a deviled egg style filling that the chopped whites get tossed in.
I hardboiled 4 eggs by simmering them in just enough water to cover for 14 minutes.
I threw together a deviled egg filling loosely inspired by <a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/great-deviled-eggs-recipe">J. Kenji's deviled egg recipe</a>.
My favorite part of this recipe is the addition of a high quality olive oil.
A peppery oil works very well.</p>
<p>This time I combined egg yolks, <a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/two-minute-mayonnaise">homemade mayo</a>, stone-ground mustard, capers, diced celery and its leaves, diced dill pickle, salt, pepper, cayenne, and paprika to create the base.
Then I whisked in some olive oil until it became a lighter consistency and added the chopped egg whites.</p>
<p>I served the egg salad in a wrap with a few leaves of red oakleaf lettuce from my countertop aerogarden.
If you like deviled eggs, this is a great excuse to make a meal out of them.</p>
