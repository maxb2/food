    <p>In my quest for colder weather foods, I decided to make <a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/roasted-broccoli-soup-buttermilk-pepitas-recipe">roasted broccoli soup</a>.
Broccoli soup is one of my favorite dishes since I was a kid.
This is a pretty straightforward recipe: roast/sweat vegetables, simmer in stock and buttermilk, and blend.
I wish I had roasted my broccoli longer as the flavor wasn't that pronounced, but I was getting impatient.</p>
<p>The toasted pepitas were very good.
I really like the combination of crunchy seeds with parsley and lemon zest.</p>
<p>Overall, I think this recipe is good, but can be improved.
I think next time I will include some rosted cauliflower to round out the the flavor.
And I'll add cheese because it makes everything better.</p>

    <p>I was searching for general fall recipes when I came across <a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/apple-sujeonggwa-korean-cinnamon-ginger-punch">apple sujeonggwa</a>.
Sujeonggwa is a cinnamon and ginger punch which is typically flavored with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sujeonggwa">dried persimmon</a>.
The recipe I followed suggested apple chips as an easier to find substitute.
The drink was extremely good both hot and cold (the traditional way).
The best way I can describe the flavor is a spicy (from the ginger) brown sugar cinnamon pop-tart.
The pine nuts were my favorite part as they added texture and complemented the spices' flavor perfectly.</p>
<p>It was also perfect timing because my friend hosted a dumpling making party the day after I made the punch.
I brought it and some apple jack to make a simple fall cocktail.
The party was a ton of fun!
I got to practice my dumpling making skills, share some drinks and even bring some dumplings home.</p>

    <p>I had panna cotta for the first time in Spain.
I enjoyed the texture the most, creamy and firm at the same time.
I randomly got a craving for it.
I found a great <a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/classic-panna-cotta-vanilla-bean-recipe">blank slate recipe</a> upon which to build.
However, I wanted some stronger flavors.
So, I steeped some crushed ginger and lemon peels in the warm milk for a couple hours.
The combination of sharp flavors and smooth texture was really delightful.
The acidic blackberries enhanced the effect too.</p>
<p>However, I did make one mistake.
I didn't let the mixture cool long enough and the cream separated from the gelatin a bit.
It was only a visual defect though.
The dish is really delightful and simple.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>
<p>I made this recipe again steeping overnight, properly cooling before pouring, and served with blueberries.
The longer steeping created more flavor and also produced a yellow oil on the top (most likely oils from the lemon peels).
The blueberries I had were not strong enough to compete with the lemon and ginger.
I'd like to try macerated fruits next time.</p>
<p>My friend also brought up that she had made "ginger milk pudding" before.
Apparently, there is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ginger_milk_curd">compound in ginger</a> that can curdle milk at the right temperature.</p>

    <p>My roommate always wants to make fried chicken sandwiches.
This time I wanted to switch it up and make something a little different, <a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/peruvian-style-grilled-chicken-sandwiches-recipe">Peruvian-Style Grilled-Chicken Sandwiches With Spicy Green Sauce</a> and grilled vegetables.</p>
<p>I went to a hardware store and bought the tiniest charcoal grill since my patio is also tiny.
I tried to grill the vegetables quickly over the chimney charcoal starter, but it was not going well.
I ended up switching to the grill to finish them off which went well.
The first batch of chicken breasts grilled nicely, though they didn't get grill marks or carmelize the sauce much.
By the time we got the final batch of chicken on the grill, it had been too long and wasn't hot enough to even cook the chicken at all.
We quickly pivoted to the oven to finish everything.</p>
<p>The end results were very tasty despite all the stress.
I liked the green sauce in particular.
I really want to try this again on a functioning grill.</p>

    <p>I saw a video from the YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/AboutToEat">About To Eat</a> for various ways to cook with peanut butter.
The braised pork interested me and I had some pork belly leftover from the <a href="posts/pasta-carbonara/">pasta carbonara</a>.</p>

<p>In the spirit of the video, I also just threw some things together into a braise.
The spices I used were gochugaru (Korean chili powder), Szechuan peppercorns, and Chinese five spice powder.
The sauce was <em>extremely</em> flavorful, almost too much.
I served it with white rice, sliced scallions, and an egg fried in the pork fat.</p>
<p>It was very good and made me happy to use some leftovers.</p>

    <p>I had an extra head of cauliflower from the time we made <a href="posts/fried-cauliflower-wings/">fried cauliflower "wings"</a>.
I found a recipe for <a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/cauliflower-cake-from-plenty-more">cauliflower cake</a> that sounded interesting.
In essence you pre-cook some cauliflower, add it to a savory cake batter, and bake.</p>
<p>The key to this dish is the spices.
I had some home grown rosemary to cook the onion and garlic with which was really nice.
The recipe also calls for nigella seeds which I don't have.
I followed the recommendations from <a href="https://www.thespruceeats.com/what-is-nigella-sativa-1763087">The Spruce Eats</a> for substitutions.
I ended up using a combination of celery seeds, oregano, caraway seeds, cumin seeds, and onion powder.</p>
<p>This batter uses a <em>ton</em> of eggs as well.
That combined with the cheese makes the texture somewhere between a moist cake and a quiche.
This was actually a huge hit.
I highly recommend making this cake.</p>

    <p>I had some egg yolks left over from making <a href="posts/homemade-klondike-bars/">homemade klondike bars</a>, so I decided to make some pasta carbonara.
Traditionally, pasta carbonara is made with guanciale, cured pork jowl.
It is somewhat difficult to get in the United States and bacon or pork belly is often suggested as an alternative.
I used half a pound of peppered, cured pork belly diced and rendered until mostly crisp.
For the sauce, I combined the three leftover egg yolks, about 100 grams each of parmesan and pecorino romano cheese, a lot of cracked black pepper, and a drizzle of olive oil in a large bowl and mixed into a paste.
I also added a dash of milk leftover from the klondike bars to loosen the sauce.</p>
<p>For cheese or oil based sauces, I like to cook my pasta in a small amount of water as shown in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWaYdGQqxQU">this video for stovetop mac and cheese</a> by J. Kenji Lopez-Alt.
This concentrates the starch in the water which helps emulsify the sauce.
Once the pasta is al dente, I drained most of the water and then tossed the pasta in the pan with the pork to emulsify the oil.
Then, I add the pasta and pork into the bowl with the sauce and vigorously toss it.
The residual heat in the pasta cooks the eggs to a custard-like consistency.</p>
<p>Pasta carbonara, cacio e pepe, and aglio e olio are all solid and quick pasta dishes that you should have at the ready.</p>

There is a great recipe for <a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/the-vegan-experience-korean-fried-cauliflower">fried cauliflower "wings"</a>.
It is good enough to rival real chicken wings.
The batter is extra crispy and the cauliflower perfectly tender.
There are recipes for a Buffalo sauce and a Korean sweet and spicy sauce.
I prefer the Korean sauce, but both are really good.</p>
<p>I also made some <a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/ranch-dressing-homemade-recipe">ranch dressing</a> which itself is based on a <a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/two-minute-mayonnaise">homemade mayo</a>.

    <p>While making <a href="posts/fried-cauliflower-wings/">fried cauliflower "wings"</a>, we made <a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/miso-glazed-salmon-in-the-toaster-oven-recipe">toaster oven salmon</a>.
For the marinade I just threw together some miso, soy sauce, brown sugar, and rice vinegar.</p>
<p>I think my toaster oven is a bit underpowered, as it took much longer than the recipe suggested.
In principle though, I really enjoy the salmon covered in a marinade or flavored mayo and broiled.
The oil coating in both cases insulates the fish from the heat so as not to dry out.
Plus, the coating can get a nice browning.

    <p>I had 6 egg whites left over from the <a href="posts/thai-tea-cake-and-coconut-custard/">coconut custard</a> I made recently.
My roommate and his girlfriend have also been eating Klondike bars a lot, so I decided to make a <a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/homemade-klondike-ice-cream-bars-recipe">homemade version</a>.</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/kfb7bo0QCxs" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>The "ice cream" is actually a combination of Swiss meringue (cooked, whipped egg whites with sugar) and whipped cream.
The texture is pretty much the same as the commercial bars.
The best part is that you can use quality chocolate which the original is severely lacking.
This recipe has a lot of leftover chocolate mixture, so I put some almonds in an icetray, covered them and froze it.</p>
<p>This recipe is pretty easy if you have a stand mixer.
It may be bearable with a hand mixer too.
The main drawback is that you must freeze things repeatedly to avoid melting while you are coating with chocolate.
It's a nice way to use up some leftover egg whites.
Ironically, we scrambled the egg whites on accident while cooking the meringue, so now I have yolks leftover.</p>
