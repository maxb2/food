I was searching for general fall recipes when I came across [apple sujeonggwa](https://www.seriouseats.com/apple-sujeonggwa-korean-cinnamon-ginger-punch).
Sujeonggwa is a cinnamon and ginger punch which is typically flavored with [dried persimmon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sujeonggwa).
The recipe I followed suggested apple chips as an easier to find substitute.
The drink was extremely good both hot and cold (the traditional way).
The best way I can describe the flavor is a spicy (from the ginger) brown sugar cinnamon pop-tart.
The pine nuts were my favorite part as they added texture and complemented the spices' flavor perfectly.

It was also perfect timing because my friend hosted a dumpling making party the day after I made the punch.
I brought it and some apple jack to make a simple fall cocktail.
The party was a ton of fun!
I got to practice my dumpling making skills, share some drinks and even bring some dumplings home.
