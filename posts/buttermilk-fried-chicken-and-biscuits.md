My roommate recently watched J. Kenji Lopez-Alt's [video on buttermilk brined fried ckicken](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5nKYqvu29w) which is [adapted from his book](https://www.seriouseats.com/the-food-lab-southern-fried-chicken-recipe).

He offered to cook everything if I broke down the whole chicken. 
I really enjoy breaking down whole chickens so that I can save the carcass for stock.
I even asked for a nice boning knife one Christmas solely for processing whole chicken and fish.
There is one oddity in this recipe in which you leave the plate attached, but cut the breast in half the short way resulting in 4 square-ish pieces. 
In my case, the tenderloin separated from the breast and the plate which made it very awkward to fry. 
We ended up with a couple tenderloin nuggets because of this.

I also made [yogurt biscuits](https://www.seriouseats.com/light-and-fluffy-biscuit-recipe) with the leftover buttermilk.
Ironically, this recipe was originally developed to replace buttermilk with yogurt.
My biscuits came out a bit dense. I imagine that the pH balance was off due to the buttermilk which affected the rise.

The chicken was pretty good, but we found that the second fry didn't add much more value for the extra time and effort.
It's only worth it if you are obsessed with crispiness.
