title: Carrot Cake Jam and Cheesecake

I visited my family recently for Easter.
We cook a big meal with a ham and multiple soup options.
My sister and I requested extra vegetables for crudit√©s.
We ended up getting too much and I brought home _a lot_ of carrots.
I was searching for a carrot cake recipe and stumbled across a [carrot cake conserve recipe](https://www.seriouseats.com/carrot-cake-conserve-recipe).
I decided to make it because it was weird and I still had some commercial pectin that I was too scared to use in my [raspberry hibiscus jam](link://slug/sous-vide-raspberry-hibiscus-cheesecake).
I had reservations on using pineapple, but it turned out really well.
It doesn't taste too much of any of the fruit included and truly does taste like carrot cake.

I combined this jam with my favorite [sous vide cheesecake recipe](link://slug/sous-vide-raspberry-hibiscus-cheesecake) to make carrot cheesecake.
Instead of using graham crackers, I just sprinkled chopped walnuts on top.
I like the cheesecake a lot, but my favorite way to eat the jam is on a bagel with cream cheese and walnuts.
