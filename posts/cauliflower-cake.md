I had an extra head of cauliflower from the time we made [fried cauliflower "wings"](link://slug/fried-cauliflower-wings).
I found a recipe for [cauliflower cake](https://www.seriouseats.com/cauliflower-cake-from-plenty-more) that sounded interesting.
In essence you pre-cook some cauliflower, add it to a savory cake batter, and bake.

The key to this dish is the spices.
I had some home grown rosemary to cook the onion and garlic with which was really nice.
The recipe also calls for nigella seeds which I don't have.
I followed the recommendations from [The Spruce Eats](https://www.thespruceeats.com/what-is-nigella-sativa-1763087) for substitutions.
I ended up using a combination of celery seeds, oregano, caraway seeds, cumin seeds, and onion powder.

This batter uses a _ton_ of eggs as well.
That combined with the cheese makes the texture somewhere between a moist cake and a quiche.
This was actually a huge hit.
I highly recommend making this cake.
