I still have a bunch of coleslaw from the [Impromptu BBQ Potluck](link://slug/impromptu-bbq-potluck) so my roommate suggested we make [spicy chicken katsu sandwiches](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOsikxHW0JQ). 
The original recipe uses lettuce and a spicy pickle mayo, but I think the coleslaw was even better.

We bought extra thighs for an upcoming meal which I deboned and deskinned. 
I'll save the bones for chicken stock and the skin for schmaltz.
