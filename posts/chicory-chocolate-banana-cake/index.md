title: Chicory Chocolate Banana Cake

I bought some chicory root online to explore some new tea blends and coffee alternative.
However, I bought far too much for just some experiments.
As usual, I searched around for some recipes to use more of it.
I decided to make [chicory chocolate banana cake](https://www.seriouseats.com/new-orleans-snack-cake).
It's definitely a bit odd, but turned out very good after sitting for a couple days.
I'd describe it as a coffee banana brownie.
