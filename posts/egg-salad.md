I little while ago I saw a video about various sandwich "salads" by Adam Ragusea.

I vaguely remembered the egg salad from that video and decided to make my own.
In particular, I remembered that his wife made a deviled egg style filling that the chopped whites get tossed in.
I hardboiled 4 eggs by simmering them in just enough water to cover for 14 minutes.
I threw together a deviled egg filling loosely inspired by [J. Kenji's deviled egg recipe](https://www.seriouseats.com/great-deviled-eggs-recipe).
My favorite part of this recipe is the addition of a high quality olive oil.
A peppery oil works very well.

This time I combined egg yolks, [homemade mayo](https://www.seriouseats.com/two-minute-mayonnaise), stone-ground mustard, capers, diced celery and its leaves, diced dill pickle, salt, pepper, cayenne, and paprika to create the base.
Then I whisked in some olive oil until it became a lighter consistency and added the chopped egg whites.

I served the egg salad in a wrap with a few leaves of red oakleaf lettuce from my countertop aerogarden.
If you like deviled eggs, this is a great excuse to make a meal out of them.
