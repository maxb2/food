I saw a video for simple [sheet pan pasta dishes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azNHrhGoOrc).

I had made something similar to the tomato based one years ago (the [viral baked feta pasta thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3gvRjIQ6Lo)).
So, I decided to try the more unusual fennel, radicchio, and white bean recipe.
However, I couldn't find radicchio and the fennel I did find was pretty anemic.
He described radicchio (I've never had it) as a bitter cross between lettuce and cabbage.
Bok choy sounded like a close enough alternative since it has a hard cabbage side and a leafy lettuce side.

I broiled everything like in the video.
I especially liked the light charring on the bok choy leaves.
I did find that it needed _both_ cheese and lemon (he said one or the other).

I thought this dish was alright, but nothing to write home about.
That's a weird phrase since I am literally writing about it...
Anyway, I like the method and will try again with other combinations.
