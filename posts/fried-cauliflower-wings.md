My roommate's girlfriend is pescatarian, so we try to find interesting dishes that accommodate her diet.
There is a great recipe for [fried cauliflower "wings"](https://www.seriouseats.com/the-vegan-experience-korean-fried-cauliflower).
It is good enough to rival real chicken wings.
The batter is extra crispy and the cauliflower perfectly tender.
There are recipes for a Buffalo sauce and a Korean sweet and spicy sauce.
I prefer the Korean sauce, but both are really good.

I also made some [ranch dressing](https://www.seriouseats.com/ranch-dressing-homemade-recipe) which itself is based on a [homemade mayo](https://www.seriouseats.com/two-minute-mayonnaise).
That mayo is a staple in my house.
The ranch dressing is really amazing.
It's much better with fresh herbs.

We also made [toaster oven salmon](link://slug/toaster-oven-salmon) to round out the meal.
