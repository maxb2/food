title: Ginger Lemon Panna Cotta with Blackberries
type: text
---

I had panna cotta for the first time in Spain.
I enjoyed the texture the most, creamy and firm at the same time.
I randomly got a craving for it.
I found a great [blank slate recipe](https://www.seriouseats.com/classic-panna-cotta-vanilla-bean-recipe) upon which to build.
However, I wanted some stronger flavors.
So, I steeped some crushed ginger and lemon peels in the warm milk for a couple hours.
The combination of sharp flavors and smooth texture was really delightful.
The acidic blackberries enhanced the effect too.

However, I did make one mistake.
I didn't let the mixture cool long enough and the cream separated from the gelatin a bit.
It was only a visual defect though.
The dish is really delightful and simple.

**Update:**

I made this recipe again steeping overnight, properly cooling before pouring, and served with blueberries.
The longer steeping created more flavor and also produced a yellow oil on the top (most likely oils from the lemon peels).
The blueberries I had were not strong enough to compete with the lemon and ginger.
I'd like to try macerated fruits next time.

My friend also brought up that she had made "ginger milk pudding" before.
Apparently, there is a [compound in ginger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ginger_milk_curd) that can curdle milk at the right temperature.
