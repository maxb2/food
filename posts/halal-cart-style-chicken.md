My roommate has a favorite [tzatziki recipe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOkL5d8t1sM) he likes to make.

When he told me he was going to make that and nothing else, I decided to help him round out the meal. 
I made the chicken and rice from Serious Eats' [Halal Cart-Style Chicken and Rice with White Sauce](https://www.seriouseats.com/serious-eats-halal-cart-style-chicken-and-rice-white-sauce-recipe) and a [Tabouli salad](https://www.themediterraneandish.com/tabouli-salad/).
I made the rice with some homemade chicken stock as well.
May favorite part of the meal is the chicken. 
The marinade is really excellent!
