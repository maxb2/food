I had 6 egg whites left over from the [coconut custard](link://slug/thai-tea-cake-and-coconut-custard) I made recently.
My roommate and his girlfriend have also been eating Klondike bars a lot, so I decided to make a [homemade version](https://www.seriouseats.com/homemade-klondike-ice-cream-bars-recipe).

The "ice cream" is actually a combination of Swiss meringue (cooked, whipped egg whites with sugar) and whipped cream.
The texture is pretty much the same as the commercial bars.
The best part is that you can use quality chocolate which the original is severely lacking.
This recipe has a lot of leftover chocolate mixture, so I put some almonds in an icetray, covered them and froze it.

This recipe is pretty easy if you have a stand mixer.
It may be bearable with a hand mixer too.
The main drawback is that you must freeze things repeatedly to avoid melting while you are coating with chocolate.
It's a nice way to use up some leftover egg whites.
Ironically, we scrambled the egg whites on accident while cooking the meringue, so now I have yolks leftover.
