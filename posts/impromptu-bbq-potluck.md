title: Impromptu BBQ Potluck
type: text
---
My friend with a smoker decided to randomly make some pulled pork this weekend. 
We decided to have an impromptu potluck.
I signed up to make the side dishes. 

My friend and I had previously lamented the over-doneness of mac and cheese at typical BBQ restaurants.
So, I made some [classic baked mac and cheese](https://www.seriouseats.com/classic-bechamel-baked-mac-cheese-recipe). 
It is just parcooked pasta in a mornay sauce with breadcrumbs on top that is baked like a casserole. 
I used cellentani instead of elbow macaroni because I like the shape better.
I also added a pinch of truffle powder to the sauce for extra flavor.

I typically don't like creamy American coleslaw because of its cloying sweetness.
However, I really wanted to top the pulled pork sandwiches with something. 
I made [creamy coleslaw](https://www.seriouseats.com/the-food-lab-how-to-make-the-best-creamy-cole-slaw) by J. Kenji Lopez-Alt.
Even though it makes a giant mess, I really like this recipe.
I think the keys to success are "curing" the vegetables, and using the best quality mayonnaise.
The best quality mayo will always be homemade.
J. Kenji also has a great (fast) [mayo recipe](https://www.seriouseats.com/two-minute-mayonnaise).

Finally, I wanted an alternative to the coleslaw, so I made [quick pickles](https://www.seriouseats.com/quick-dill-pickle-chips-recipe). 
They taste strongly of dill, garlic, and vinegar which is my favorite kind of pickle.

Overall, it was a great success!
