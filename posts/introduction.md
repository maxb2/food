People always ask  me, "What is your favorite thing/cuisine to make?" 
I struggle to answer this question because I'm interested in so many different things *and* I never write down my thoughts as I'm exploring them.
This food blog is an attempt to keep track of my culinary explorations, gather data about my preferences, and learn about [static site generators](https://jamstack.org/generators/). 

If you found your way here from the internet, I don't know if this blog will be helpful, *but* welcome anyway!
