I had a lot of leftover frozen corn, so I made [Korean Cheese Corn](https://www.seriouseats.com/korean-corn-cheese-5196495).
I didn't have doenjang, so I replaced it with white miso and a little gochujang.
It's decent, but I didn't like it as the main course. 
It would probably be much better with lots of beer and other appetizers like the article says.
