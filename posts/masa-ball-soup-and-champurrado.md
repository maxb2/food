When I was researching the [matzo ball soup](link://slug/schmaltz-garlic-confit-and-matzo-ball-soup), I came across something amusing: [Masa ball soup](https://www.seriouseats.com/how-to-make-masa-ball-soup-mexican-jewish-matzo-corn).
It's a Mexican take on the original dish. 
Both are essentially dumplings in chicken soup.
The dumplings here are made of masa, a specially treated corn flour used in tortillas, tamales, etc.
The last minor differences are using squash and cilantro instead of carrots and dill.
It's those changes that give the dish a Mexican flavor.

The masa ball dough was pretty loose which made me fear that the balls would disintegrate while cooking.
Fortunately, they stayed together despite being a bit deformed.
Overall, this was the best tasting pun I've eaten, but I prefer the original a little more.



While I had the masa flour out, I decided to try making [champurrado](https://www.seriouseats.com/champurrado-mexican-hot-chocolate-corn-drink-recipe), a thickened hot chocolate drink.
I felt like the recipe was a bit lacking, so I added some cayenne, cumin, and coriander.
It was pretty good, but not the right time of year for hot chocolate.
One plus is that it sets up as a pudding when cooled which fit the season better.
