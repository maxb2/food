I saw a video from the YouTube channel [About To Eat](https://www.youtube.com/c/AboutToEat) for various ways to cook with peanut butter.
The braised pork interested me and I had some pork belly leftover from the [pasta carbonara](link://slug/pasta-carbonara).

In the spirit of the video, I also just threw some things together into a braise.
The spices I used were gochugaru (Korean chili powder), Szechuan peppercorns, and Chinese five spice powder.
The sauce was _extremely_ flavorful, almost too much.
I served it with white rice, sliced scallions, and an egg fried in the pork fat.

It was very good and made me happy to use some leftovers.
