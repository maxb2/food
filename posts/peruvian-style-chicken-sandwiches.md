My roommate always wants to make fried chicken sandwiches.
This time I wanted to switch it up and make something a little different, [Peruvian-Style Grilled-Chicken Sandwiches With Spicy Green Sauce](https://www.seriouseats.com/peruvian-style-grilled-chicken-sandwiches-recipe) and grilled vegetables.

I went to a hardware store and bought the tiniest charcoal grill since my patio is also tiny.
I tried to grill the vegetables quickly over the chimney charcoal starter, but it was not going well.
I ended up switching to the grill to finish them off which went well.
The first batch of chicken breasts grilled nicely, though they didn't get grill marks or carmelize the sauce much.
By the time we got the final batch of chicken on the grill, it had been too long and wasn't hot enough to even cook the chicken at all.
We quickly pivoted to the oven to finish everything.

The end results were very tasty despite all the stress.
I liked the green sauce in particular.
I really want to try this again on a functioning grill.
