On occasion I will scour the internet for recipes to use up an indegredient I have too much of (see the [pantry-raid](link://tag/pantry-raid) tag).
This time I was looking for old-fashioned oatmeal recipes, but it led me to another unused ingredient, pureed pumpkin.
I originally bought it when I was experimenting with a low-carb diet and didn't really like it in less sweet applications. 

Serendipitously, a [pumpkin skillet coffee cake with oatmeal streusel](https://www.seriouseats.com/pumpkin-skillet-coffeecake-with-streusel-topping) could use both of these ingredients.
I really liked this cake, especially the texture that the white chocolate adds.
I didn't have any pecans, so I replaced them with some walnuts and pepitas (green pumpkin seeds).

Unfortunately, this only used a fraction of each ingredient.
It didn't even use the whole can of pureed pumpkin that I opened.
