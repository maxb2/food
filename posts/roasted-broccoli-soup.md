In my quest for colder weather foods, I decided to make [roasted broccoli soup](https://www.seriouseats.com/roasted-broccoli-soup-buttermilk-pepitas-recipe).
Broccoli soup is one of my favorite dishes since I was a kid.
This is a pretty straightforward recipe: roast/sweat vegetables, simmer in stock and buttermilk, and blend.
I wish I had roasted my broccoli longer as the flavor wasn't that pronounced, but I was getting impatient.

The toasted pepitas were very good.
I really like the combination of crunchy seeds with parsley and lemon zest.

Overall, I think this recipe is good, but can be improved.
I think next time I will include some rosted cauliflower to round out the the flavor.
And I'll add cheese because it makes everything better.
