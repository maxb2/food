In 2017 I visited New Orleans for a work conference.
On my last day there, I had crawfish étouffée for the first time.
It was so good that it made a lasting impression on me.
Last year, I tried the crawfish étouffée from a new-ish Cajun restaurant where I live.
Unfortunately, I was not impressed.
To be fair, it was not bad, I was just comparing it to a rose-tinted memory of a dish made by the actual authorities on the dish.
Nonetheless, the experience inspired me to make étouffée myself.

I used the Serious Eats recipe for [shrimp étouffée](https://www.seriouseats.com/shrimp-etouffee) since it's a bit difficult to get crawfish where I live.
It consists of two major operations: making a shrimp stock and making the étouffée itself.
The base of the stock is made from the shells of the shrimp used later in the main dish.
It is a relatively quick stock since you are only extracting flavor and not gelatin like a bone-based stock or broth.
However, it still helps to split the two operations up in time.
The recipe also makes enough stock for two batches of étouffée.
So, I froze one quart for a future use.

All of which brings us to the present day where I was searching for something to make and remembered the special purpose shrimp stock that had been in my freezer for a year. 
Making the étouffée itself is pretty simple, it's just make a roux, sweat some [Cajun trinity vegetables](https://www.thespruceeats.com/cajun-trinity-of-cooking-3052290), add spices and the stock, simmer until vegetables are soft, and cook your meat in the sauce.
In my opinion, the most impactful step is making the roux.
I like a "peanut butter" colored roux because it adds a complex, nutty flavor without overshadowing the other flavors.
This time, I also added some home grown garlic scapes as a garnish.
Finally, serve with rice and a dry white wine.
