## Feeding


This feeding schedule minimizes discard and maximizes sour/funky flavors.

- Keep your starter in the fridge.
  This lets you feed at a slower pace and build up more slow fermentation flavors.
- Feed weekly approximately 2:1 _by weight_.
  A 2:1 feed keeps the starter hungry and producing funky flavors.
  If your starter seems unhappy feed it 1:1 or even higher to reset the balance.

    > Measuring by weight is the only way to be consistent in baking.
        [Baker's percentages](https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/pro/reference/bakers-percentage) always refer to the the total flour weight being 100%.
        So, a 100% hydration dough means equal weights of flour and water.

    - Other ways to express the 2:1 feeding ratio:
        - Add half the weight of your starter in 100% hydration feeding paste.
        - 2 parts existing starter to 1 part 100% hydration feeding paste.
        - 4 parts existing starter, 1 part flour (I typically do a mix of AP and whole wheat), 1 part filtered/spring/distilled water.

- Keep the starter in a vessel big enough to allow 1.5-3x expansion.
  I use a swing top jar with a rubber band to hold the lid but also let gas escape.
- Discard some starter if you are running out of room.
  See _Other Recipes_ below for ways to use your discard.
  Or, just gift some to your friends!
- A clear/grey liquid on top of your starter is normal.
  It is a mix of alcohol and acids that is a natural byproduct of lacto-fermentaion, sometimes called "hooch".
  You can either pour it off and discard it or mix it back in when feeding.
  > Too much acid/alcohol buildup can harm your colony.
    It shouldn't be a problem if you are regularly feeding though.

## Baking

The night before you want to bake, make a [levain](https://www.theperfectloaf.com/what-is-a-levain-and-how-is-it-different-from-a-starter/#h-what-is-a-levain):

1. Take out some starter, feed it 1:1, and leave it out at room temperature (make a bit more than your recipe requires).
2. Use it as "ripe starter" in your recipe the next day.
3. Any leftover levain can be discarded or fed to the main starter.
