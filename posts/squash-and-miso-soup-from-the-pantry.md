title: Squash and Miso Soup From the Pantry
type: text

I wanted to make [Miso-Squash Soup With Sesame-Ginger Apples](https://www.seriouseats.com/miso-squash-soup-recipe), but I couldn't find all the ingredients.
In particular, I couldn't find bonito flakes at the normal place.
[Bonito flakes (katsuobushi)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katsuobushi) are simmered, smoked and fermented skipjack tuna.
They give dashi (kombu + katsuobushi), a japanese fish stock which is the base of miso soup, a smoky/meaty flavor.
I couldn't even find it (or instant dashi for that matter!) in the biggest Asian market in my city.
So, I had to improvise a bit.
A while ago, I was really into making different kinds of stocks.
I had frozen quarts of a [vegan stock](https://www.seriouseats.com/hearty-vegetable-stock-vegan-recipe) and a [French fish stock (fumet)](https://www.seriouseats.com/fish-stock-fumet-recipe).
I decided to replace the dashi with a combination of these two stocks because the vegan stock included kombu and dried mushrooms while the fumet was the only fishy stock I had.

I boosted the fish flavor with some anchovy paste that I normally use in Italian dishes.
I also used two acorn squash instead of the butternut asked for in the recipe.
I like acorn squash because you can eat the thinner skin once cooked and they work very well in braised dishes.

I really like this dish because it reminds me of fall with the squash and apples, but still has a distinct flavor from the Asian ingredients.
Emptying my older pantry items is a big plus as well.
