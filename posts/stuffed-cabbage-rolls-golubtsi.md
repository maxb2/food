I recently saw [Helen Rennie's](https://www.youtube.com/c/helenrennie) video for stuffed cabbage rolls.

Since I love cabbage, I really wanted to try it.
I have a few pounds of ground deer meat that I got from a hunter friend, so I replaced the veal in the meatloaf mix with deer.
I also used the optional gelatin as a safegaurd.

Trimming the stems of the cabbage leaves was a great way to increase the flexibility of the leaves.
The filling was still a bit too crumbly at the end.
I could add more binders to the mix (breadcrumbs and eggs), and/or knead the mixture more to get it tighter.
My sauce also didn't reduce much during the braise, but that is not a problem when serving the rolls browned as suggested in the video.

There are a lot of steps in the process, but it felt very manageable with two people.
One of us focused on the cabbage and sauce while the other focused on the filling and forming of the rolls.
