My sister recently planned a trip to visit my family.
She requested that we have a fish fry which is something we used to do a lot growing up.
It would be a big potluck for the small river town that we spent a lot of time at.
The fishermen would catch a bunch of catfish, carp, and walleye and then spend all day frying them.
There would also be a ton of side dishes and lawn games.
It was a formative memory for all of us kids.

She also said she was bringing sweet corn and I had recently seen Kenji's video on [sweet corn elotes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zhe4xOaypO4).

I brought [homemade mayo](https://www.seriouseats.com/two-minute-mayonnaise), cotija cheese, and my popcorn spice blend.
The popcorn spice blend came from a New York Times article a long time ago, which is no longer available sadly.
I've forgotten the exact ratios, but it consists of paprika, cayenne, salt, garlic powder, and pepper.
It's basically a grilling spice blend such as Lawry's.

I made the elotes just like in the video and it was amazing!
I think it's way better than just buttered corn.
