While making [fried cauliflower "wings"](link://slug/fried-cauliflower-wings), we made [toaster oven salmon](https://www.seriouseats.com/miso-glazed-salmon-in-the-toaster-oven-recipe).
For the marinade I just threw together some miso, soy sauce, brown sugar, and rice vinegar.

I think my toaster oven is a bit underpowered, as it took much longer than the recipe suggested.
In principle though, I really enjoy the salmon covered in a marinade or flavored mayo and broiled.
The oil coating in both cases insulates the fish from the heat so as not to dry out.
Plus, the coating can get a nice browning.
I also make [broiled salmon with harissa spice mayo](https://www.seriouseats.com/baked-broiled-salmon-harissa-mayonnaise) quite often.
