The Independence Day gathering that I brought the [Baked Alaska](link://slug/practical-baked-alaska) to was a potluck.
The host made a really good watermelon, spinach, parmesan, and Balsamic vinagrette salad.
The watermelon they bought was _huge_, so they sent me home with half of it.
I found a [watermelon gazpacho recipe](https://www.seriouseats.com/watermelon-gazpacho-with-calabrian-chili-crema) to try to use it all up.

I couldn't find Calabrian chilis, so I just used some serranos.
I also found that it needed much more vinegar than the recipe called for.
Actually, it was quite hard to season the fresh soup, probably because it was cold and the flavors needed to mingle.
It turned out really well after resting in the fridge though.
This made me really appreciate the spicy watermelon combo.

I still have way too much frozen watermelon leftover though...
