I brought home some frozen dumplings from a [dumpling making party](link://slug/apple-sujeonggwa).
I decided to make wonton soup (loosely based on [this recipe](https://www.seriouseats.com/homemade-wonton-soup-recipe)) with what I had on hand.

I tend to freeze scraps from other projects until I have enough to make a stock.
This time I hade some mushroom stems, ginger peels and bits too small to use, the green parts of some leek, some chicken bones, and a lot of shrimp shells.
First, I lightly sauteed the shrimp shells to bring out their flavor. 
Next, I added the rest of the scraps, some kombu, black peppercorns, coriander seeds, and cumin seeds.
I brought everything to a boil and actually had a hard time keeping the pot from boiling over since there were too many ingredients.
I solved that problem by placing a steamer basket upside down on the stock and used the weight of the lid to hold the solids below the surface of the liquid.
I simmered that for 1-2 hours (there were not that many bones to extract gelatin from).
Before straining, I bloomed two packets of gelatin in the bottom of the collection bowl to bolster the mouth feel.
Finally, I strained and refrigerated the stock until I was ready to make the soup.
