I enjoyed the texture the most, creamy and firm at the same time.
I randomly got a craving for it.
I found a great &lt;a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/classic-panna-cotta-vanilla-bean-recipe"&gt;blank slate recipe&lt;/a&gt; upon which to build.
However, I wanted some stronger flavors.
So, I steeped some crushed ginger and lemon peels in the warm milk for a couple hours.
The combination of sharp flavors and smooth texture was really delightful.
The acidic blackberries enhanced the effect too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I did make one mistake.
I didn't let the mixture cool long enough and the cream separated from the gelatin a bit.
It was only a visual defect though.
The dish is really delightful and simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made this recipe again steeping overnight, properly cooling before pouring, and served with blueberries.
The longer steeping created more flavor and also produced a yellow oil on the top (most likely oils from the lemon peels).
The blueberries I had were not strong enough to compete with the lemon and ginger.
I'd like to try macerated fruits next time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My friend also brought up that she had made "ginger milk pudding" before.
Apparently, there is a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ginger_milk_curd"&gt;compound in ginger&lt;/a&gt; that can curdle milk at the right temperature.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>dessert</category><category>fruit</category><category>gelatin</category><category>ginger</category><category>lemon</category><category>milk</category><category>Serious Eats</category><guid>https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/ginger-lemon-panna-cotta-with-blackberries/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 06 Aug 2022 20:49:48 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Peanut Butter Braised Pork</title><link>https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/peanut-butter-braised-pork/</link><dc:creator>Matt Anderson</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;I saw a video from the YouTube channel &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/AboutToEat"&gt;About To Eat&lt;/a&gt; for various ways to cook with peanut butter.
The braised pork interested me and I had some pork belly leftover from the &lt;a href="https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/pasta-carbonara/"&gt;pasta carbonara&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/xXvA1cKfpTs" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the spirit of the video, I also just threw some things together into a braise.
The spices I used were gochugaru (Korean chili powder), Szechuan peppercorns, and Chinese five spice powder.
The sauce was &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; flavorful, almost too much.
I served it with white rice, sliced scallions, and an egg fried in the pork fat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was very good and made me happy to use some leftovers.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>About To Eat</category><category>braise</category><category>gochugaru</category><category>pantry raid</category><category>peanut butter</category><category>pork belly</category><category>rice</category><category>Szechuan</category><category>Youtube</category><guid>https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/peanut-butter-braised-pork/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 29 Jul 2022 01:10:49 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Cauliflower Cake</title><link>https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/cauliflower-cake/</link><dc:creator>Matt Anderson</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;I had an extra head of cauliflower from the time we made &lt;a href="https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/fried-cauliflower-wings/"&gt;fried cauliflower "wings"&lt;/a&gt;.
I found a recipe for &lt;a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/cauliflower-cake-from-plenty-more"&gt;cauliflower cake&lt;/a&gt; that sounded interesting.
In essence you pre-cook some cauliflower, add it to a savory cake batter, and bake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key to this dish is the spices.
I had some home grown rosemary to cook the onion and garlic with which was really nice.
The recipe also calls for nigella seeds which I don't have.
I followed the recommendations from &lt;a href="https://www.thespruceeats.com/what-is-nigella-sativa-1763087"&gt;The Spruce Eats&lt;/a&gt; for substitutions.
I ended up using a combination of celery seeds, oregano, caraway seeds, cumin seeds, and onion powder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This batter uses a &lt;em&gt;ton&lt;/em&gt; of eggs as well.
That combined with the cheese makes the texture somewhere between a moist cake and a quiche.
This was actually a huge hit.
I highly recommend making this cake.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>cake</category><category>cauliflower</category><category>eggs</category><category>onion</category><category>pantry raid</category><category>rosemary</category><category>Serious Eats</category><guid>https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/cauliflower-cake/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 23 Jul 2022 18:52:54 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Pasta Carbonara</title><link>https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/pasta-carbonara/</link><dc:creator>Matt Anderson</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;I had some egg yolks left over from making &lt;a href="https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/homemade-klondike-bars/"&gt;homemade klondike bars&lt;/a&gt;, so I decided to make some pasta carbonara.
Traditionally, pasta carbonara is made with guanciale, cured pork jowl.
It is somewhat difficult to get in the United States and bacon or pork belly is often suggested as an alternative.
I used half a pound of peppered, cured pork belly diced and rendered until mostly crisp.
For the sauce, I combined the three leftover egg yolks, about 100 grams each of parmesan and pecorino romano cheese, a lot of cracked black pepper, and a drizzle of olive oil in a large bowl and mixed into a paste.
I also added a dash of milk leftover from the klondike bars to loosen the sauce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For cheese or oil based sauces, I like to cook my pasta in a small amount of water as shown in &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWaYdGQqxQU"&gt;this video for stovetop mac and cheese&lt;/a&gt; by J. Kenji Lopez-Alt.
This concentrates the starch in the water which helps emulsify the sauce.
Once the pasta is al dente, I drained most of the water and then tossed the pasta in the pan with the pork to emulsify the oil.
Then, I add the pasta and pork into the bowl with the sauce and vigorously toss it.
The residual heat in the pasta cooks the eggs to a custard-like consistency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pasta carbonara, cacio e pepe, and aglio e olio are all solid and quick pasta dishes that you should have at the ready.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>black pepper</category><category>egg yolk</category><category>Italian</category><category>pantry raid</category><category>parmesan</category><category>pasta</category><category>pecorino romano</category><category>pork belly</category><guid>https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/pasta-carbonara/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 22 Jul 2022 03:22:50 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Fried Cauliflower "Wings"</title><link>https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/fried-cauliflower-wings/</link><dc:creator>Matt Anderson</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;My roommate's girlfriend is pescatarian, so we try to find interesting dishes that accommodate her diet.
There is a great recipe for &lt;a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/the-vegan-experience-korean-fried-cauliflower"&gt;fried cauliflower "wings"&lt;/a&gt;.
It is good enough to rival real chicken wings.
The batter is extra crispy and the cauliflower perfectly tender.
There are recipes for a Buffalo sauce and a Korean sweet and spicy sauce.
I prefer the Korean sauce, but both are really good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also made some &lt;a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/ranch-dressing-homemade-recipe"&gt;ranch dressing&lt;/a&gt; which itself is based on a &lt;a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/two-minute-mayonnaise"&gt;homemade mayo&lt;/a&gt;.
That mayo is a staple in my house.
The ranch dressing is really amazing.
It's much better with fresh herbs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also made &lt;a href="https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/toaster-oven-salmon/"&gt;toaster oven salmon&lt;/a&gt; to round out the meal.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>Asian</category><category>cauliflower</category><category>deep fried</category><category>friends</category><category>ginger</category><category>Kenji</category><category>mayo</category><category>ranch</category><category>sauce</category><category>Serious Eats</category><category>soy</category><category>vegan</category><category>wings</category><guid>https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/fried-cauliflower-wings/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 18 Jul 2022 02:37:18 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Toaster Oven Salmon</title><link>https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/toaster-oven-salmon/</link><dc:creator>Matt Anderson</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;While making &lt;a href="https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/fried-cauliflower-wings/"&gt;fried cauliflower "wings"&lt;/a&gt;, we made &lt;a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/miso-glazed-salmon-in-the-toaster-oven-recipe"&gt;toaster oven salmon&lt;/a&gt;.
For the marinade I just threw together some miso, soy sauce, brown sugar, and rice vinegar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think my toaster oven is a bit underpowered, as it took much longer than the recipe suggested.
In principle though, I really enjoy the salmon covered in a marinade or flavored mayo and broiled.
The oil coating in both cases insulates the fish from the heat so as not to dry out.
Plus, the coating can get a nice browning.
I also make &lt;a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/baked-broiled-salmon-harissa-mayonnaise"&gt;broiled salmon with harissa spice mayo&lt;/a&gt; quite often.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>friends</category><category>Kenji</category><category>miso</category><category>rice vinegar</category><category>salmon</category><category>Serious Eats</category><category>soy</category><category>toaster oven</category><guid>https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/toaster-oven-salmon/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 18 Jul 2022 02:36:54 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Homemade Klondike Bars</title><link>https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/homemade-klondike-bars/</link><dc:creator>Matt Anderson</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;I had 6 egg whites left over from the &lt;a href="https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/thai-tea-cake-and-coconut-custard/"&gt;coconut custard&lt;/a&gt; I made recently.
My roommate and his girlfriend have also been eating Klondike bars a lot, so I decided to make a &lt;a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/homemade-klondike-ice-cream-bars-recipe"&gt;homemade version&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/kfb7bo0QCxs" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The "ice cream" is actually a combination of Swiss meringue (cooked, whipped egg whites with sugar) and whipped cream.
The texture is pretty much the same as the commercial bars.
The best part is that you can use quality chocolate which the original is severely lacking.
This recipe has a lot of leftover chocolate mixture, so I put some almonds in an icetray, covered them and froze it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This recipe is pretty easy if you have a stand mixer.
It may be bearable with a hand mixer too.
The main drawback is that you must freeze things repeatedly to avoid melting while you are coating with chocolate.
It's a nice way to use up some leftover egg whites.
Ironically, we scrambled the egg whites on accident while cooking the meringue, so now I have yolks leftover.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>chocolate</category><category>friends</category><category>ice cream</category><category>meringue</category><category>pantry raid</category><category>Serious Eats</category><category>stand mixer</category><category>Stella Parks</category><guid>https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/homemade-klondike-bars/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 18 Jul 2022 02:36:37 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Fennel and Bok Choy Sheet Pan Pasta</title><link>https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/fennel-and-bok-choy-sheet-pan-pasta/</link><dc:creator>Matt Anderson</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;I saw a video for simple &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azNHrhGoOrc"&gt;sheet pan pasta dishes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/azNHrhGoOrc" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had made something similar to the tomato based one years ago (the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3gvRjIQ6Lo"&gt;viral baked feta pasta thing&lt;/a&gt;).
So, I decided to try the more unusual fennel, radicchio, and white bean recipe.
However, I couldn't find radicchio and the fennel I did find was pretty anemic.
He described radicchio (I've never had it) as a bitter cross between lettuce and cabbage.
Bok choy sounded like a close enough alternative since it has a hard cabbage side and a leafy lettuce side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I broiled everything like in the video.
I especially liked the light charring on the bok choy leaves.
I did find that it needed &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; cheese and lemon (he said one or the other).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought this dish was alright, but nothing to write home about.
That's a weird phrase since I am literally writing about it...
Anyway, I like the method and will try again with other combinations.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>Adam Ragusea</category><category>bok choy</category><category>fennel</category><category>pasta</category><category>sheet pan</category><category>Youtube</category><guid>https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/fennel-and-bok-choy-sheet-pan-pasta/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 18 Jul 2022 02:36:06 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Thai Tea Cake and Coconut Custard</title><link>https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/thai-tea-cake-and-coconut-custard/</link><dc:creator>Matt Anderson</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;I bought a pound of loose leaf Thai tea a while back because I really love Thai iced tea in restaurants.
For a while, I was making it all the time at home with various milks.
The drink is really good, but I wanted to find something else to try.
I found a &lt;a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/thai-tea-cake-with-condensed-milk-custard-sauce-recipe"&gt;Thai tea cake with custard recipe&lt;/a&gt;.
The cake is pretty straightforward, even though I had to buy a new pan.
You just steep the tea in some warm milk before incorporating into the cake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the custard, I couldn't find sweetened condensed milk, only sweetened condensed &lt;em&gt;coconut&lt;/em&gt; milk.
I felt that was perhaps a more fitting alternative anyway.
The custard was pretty standard as well.
However, it uses 6 egg yolks, so I didn't actually reduce my unused pantry ingredients with all the extra egg whites sitting around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a really great desert.
The cake becomes a nice orange color and the coconut custard awesome.
I only wish that the tea flavor were stronger.
You have to eat the cake without any custard to get any hint of tea.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>cake</category><category>coconut</category><category>custard</category><category>pantry raid</category><category>Serious Eats</category><category>tea</category><category>Thai</category><guid>https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/thai-tea-cake-and-coconut-custard/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 18 Jul 2022 02:35:39 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Pumpkin Sweet Swirl Buns</title><link>https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/pumpkin-sweet-swirl-buns/</link><dc:creator>Matt Anderson</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;In my last post, I made a &lt;a href="https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/pumpkin-skillet-coffee-cake/"&gt;pumpkin coffee cake&lt;/a&gt; that left me with a decent amount of opened pumpkin puree.
So, in an attempt to use it before it goes bad, I made &lt;a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/pumpkin-sweet-swirl-buns"&gt;pumpkin sweet swirl buns&lt;/a&gt; (similar to cinnamon buns).
I didn't have graham crackers, so I ground up a crunchy granola bar that aready had pimpkin seeds in it.
I also had to grind hazelnuts into a meal which is a bit tricky not to turn into nut butter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This used almost all of the remaining puree which is great. 
It also let me use my stand mixer to knead the dough.
I'm glad for any chance to use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first, I was afraid I didn't roll the dough tight enough to get a good swirl.
However, the overnight proof in the fridge filled in the gaps.
I also made a cream cheese frosting by whipping cream cheese, lemon juice, vanilla extract, and powdered sugar together.
You can add a little bit of water to thin it out to your desired consistency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The buns were really good!
They were perfectly fluffy, a nice shade of orange, and the hazelnut filling was a perfect match for the spices.
My only (minor) complaint is that the pumpkin flavor was not strong enough.
I think the best takeaway is to try other fillings for cinnamon rolls.
The dough is just a fluffy, yeasty, buttery vehicle for the filling.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>hazelnut</category><category>pantry raid</category><category>pumpkin</category><category>Serious Eats</category><guid>https://maxb2.github.io/food/posts/pumpkin-sweet-swirl-buns/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 09 Jul 2022 23:19:01 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
